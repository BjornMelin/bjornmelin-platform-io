### 8.5 🛡️ **Strict Zod Schema Validation & Type Safety (2025 Best Practices)**

**Philosophy: Runtime Type Safety + Compile-Time Guarantees**
- **Zero runtime type errors** through comprehensive validation

- **Form validation consistency** across all user inputs
- **Database type safety** with runtime validation
- **Error messages clarity** for excellent UX

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Factor common logic into clear, reusable utilities
- **High Maintainability:** Write code you'd want to maintain in 6 months
- **Low Complexity:** Advanced features with simple, clean implementations

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Simple, clear, maintainable
export function formatCurrency(amount: number, currency = 'USD'): string {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency
  }).format(amount);
}

// ❌ BAD: Over-engineered, unnecessary abstraction
export class CurrencyFormatterFactory {
  private static instances = new Map<string, CurrencyFormatter>();
  
  static getInstance(locale: string): CurrencyFormatter {
    if (!this.instances.has(locale)) {
      this.instances.set(locale, new CurrencyFormatter(locale));
    }
    return this.instances.get(locale)!;
  }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Direct, obvious implementation
export const useContactForm = () => {
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  
  const handleSubmit = async (data: ContactFormData) => {
    setIsSubmitting(true);
    try {
      await submitContactForm(data);
      toast.success('Thank you! I\'ll be in touch soon.');
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error('Something went wrong. Please try again.');
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false);
    }
  };
  
  return { handleSubmit, isSubmitting };
};

// ❌ BAD: Over-abstracted, hard to follow
export class FormSubmissionOrchestrator<T extends FormData> {
  constructor(
    private validator: Validator<T>,
    private submitter: Submitter<T>,
    private notifier: Notifier,
    private stateManager: StateManager
  ) {}
  
  async orchestrate(data: T): Promise<SubmissionResult<T>> {
    // Complex orchestration logic...
  }
}
```

**Decision-Making Framework:**
1. **Start Simple:** Begin with the most straightforward implementation
2. **Measure Necessity:** Only add complexity when there's a clear, measurable need
3. **Prefer Composition:** Use function composition over complex inheritance
4. **Choose Boring Technology:** Favor proven, stable solutions over bleeding-edge
5. **Optimize Later:** Get it working correctly first, then optimize if needed

**Technology Selection Criteria:**
- **Developer Experience:** Does it make development faster and more enjoyable?
- **Maintenance Burden:** Will this be easy to maintain and upgrade?
- **Community Support:** Is there active development and good documentation?
- **Performance Impact:** Does it provide clear performance benefits?
- **Learning Curve:** Can the team learn it quickly and effectively?

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **Next.js App Router:** Modern, simple routing with excellent DX
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling that scales without complexity
- **Zod:** Simple, powerful validation that generates TypeScript types
- **Playwright:** One tool for all E2E testing needs
- **Biome:** Single tool replacing ESLint + Prettier + import sorting
- **Vercel Deployment:** Zero-config deployment with excellent performance
```

  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 
    0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),
    inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}

.glass-card-dark {
  background: rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.7);
  border: 1px solid rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.1);
  box-shadow: 
    0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3),
    inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
}
```

## 14. Security & Compliance

### 14.1 Security Framework (Enterprise-Grade)

#### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Modern security implementation with 2025 standards
interface SecurityConfig {
  authentication: {
    provider: 'NextAuth.js v5' | 'Clerk' | 'Auth0';
    methods: ['passwordless', 'oauth', 'passkeys'];
    sessionManagement: 'JWT' | 'database';
    tokenExpiry: string;
  };
  authorization: {
    rbac: boolean;              // Role-based access control
    permissions: Permission[];
    adminRoutes: string[];
  };

  };
}

// Implementation with NextAuth.js v5 (Latest)
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"
import { DynamoDBAdapter } from "@auth/dynamodb-adapter"

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  adapter: DynamoDBAdapter(dynamoClient),
  providers: [
    GitHub({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    })
  ],
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
  },
  callbacks: {
    authorized: async ({ auth, request: { nextUrl } }) => {
      const isLoggedIn = !!auth?.user;
      const isAdminRoute = nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard');
      
      if (isAdminRoute) {
        return isLoggedIn && auth.user.email === process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL;
      }
      
      return true;
    },
  },
})
```

#### Data Protection & Privacy
```typescript
// GDPR & Privacy Compliance Implementation
interface PrivacyFramework {
  dataMinimization: {
    collectOnlyNecessary: boolean;
    automaticDeletion: boolean;
    retentionPeriods: {
      analytics: '90 days';
      contactForms: '2 years';
      newsletters: 'until unsubscribe';
    };

    processingRestriction: boolean; // Right to restrict processing
  };
  
  cookieManagement: {
    essential: string[];        // Required for functionality
    functional: string[];       // Enhance user experience
    analytics: string[];        // Performance & usage tracking
    marketing: string[];        // Personalization & targeting
    consentRequired: boolean;
  };
  
  securityMeasures: {
    encryption: 'end-to-end';
    accessControls: 'role-based';
    auditLogging: boolean;
    vulnerabilityScanning: 'continuous';
    incidentResponse: 'automated';
  };

      onAcceptAll={() => handleConsentUpdate({ all: true })}
      onRejectAll={() => handleConsentUpdate({ essential: true })}
      onCustomize={(prefs) => handleConsentUpdate(prefs)}
    />
  );
}
```

### 14.2 Security Best Practices (2025 Standards)

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```typescript
// Next.js Middleware for Security Headers
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  
  // Content Security Policy
  const csp = [
    "default-src 'self'",
    "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https://vercel.live",
    "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com",
    "img-src 'self' data: blob: https://*.amazonaws.com https://images.unsplash.com",
    "font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com",
    "connect-src 'self' https://api.openai.com https://vitals.vercel-insights.com",
    "frame-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com",
    "object-src 'none'",
    "base-uri 'self'",
    "form-action 'self'",
    "frame-ancestors 'none'"
  ].join('; ');
  
  // Security Headers
  response.headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', csp);
  response.headers.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  response.headers.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  response.headers.set('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
  response.headers.set('Permissions-Policy', 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()');
  response.headers.set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
  
  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
}
```

#### API Security & Rate Limiting
```typescript
// API Route Protection with Rate Limiting
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

const redis = new Redis({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
});

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: redis,
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10 s"), // 10 requests per 10 seconds
  analytics: true,
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Rate limiting
  const ip = request.headers.get("x-forwarded-for") ?? "127.0.0.1";
  const { success, limit, reset, remaining } = await ratelimit.limit(ip);
  
  if (!success) {
    return Response.json(
      { error: "Rate limit exceeded" }, 
      { 
        status: 429,
        headers: {
          "X-RateLimit-Limit": limit.toString(),
          "X-RateLimit-Remaining": remaining.toString(),
          "X-RateLimit-Reset": new Date(reset).toISOString(),
        }
      }
    );
  }
  
  // Input validation with Zod
  const bodySchema = z.object({
    name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
    email: z.string().email(),
    message: z.string().min(10).max(1000),
    projectType: z.enum(['consulting', 'development', 'architecture']),
  });
  
  try {
    const validatedData = bodySchema.parse(await request.json());
    
    // Sanitize inputs
    const sanitizedData = {
      name: DOMPurify.sanitize(validatedData.name),
      email: validatedData.email.toLowerCase().trim(),
      message: DOMPurify.sanitize(validatedData.message),
      projectType: validatedData.projectType,
    };
    
    // Process the request...
    return Response.json({ success: true });
    
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json(
      { error: "Invalid input" }, 
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }
}
```

### 14.3 Infrastructure Security (AWS)

#### WAF & DDoS Protection
```typescript
// AWS CDK Security Stack
import * as wafv2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-wafv2';
import * as cloudfront from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront';

export class SecurityStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    
    // WAF Web ACL with comprehensive rules
    const webAcl = new wafv2.CfnWebACL(this, 'PortfolioWAF', {
      scope: 'CLOUDFRONT',

### 15.2 Optimization Strategies

#### Advanced Caching Architecture
```typescript
// Multi-layer caching strategy
interface CachingStrategy {
  edge: {
    provider: 'CloudFront + Vercel Edge';
    ttl: {
      static: '365 days',
      api: '1 hour',
      dynamic: '5 minutes'
    };
    features: ['Brotli compression', 'HTTP/3', 'Smart routing'];
  };
  
  application: {
    strategy: 'SWR + React Query';
    policies: {
      immediate: 'Show cached, revalidate background',
      staleWhileRevalidate: '24 hours',
      errorFallback: 'Serve stale on error'
    };
  };
  
  database: {
    layer: 'Redis + DynamoDB DAX';
    patterns: ['Read-through', 'Write-behind', 'Cache-aside'];
    invalidation: 'Event-driven + TTL';
  };
}

// Next.js 15 App Router Caching Implementation
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  // Static generation for known routes
  const projects = await getProjects();
  return projects.map((project) => ({ slug: project.slug }));
}

export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour

export default async function ProjectPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  // Cached data fetching with Next.js 15
  const project = await fetch(`/api/projects/${params.slug}`, {
    next: { 
      revalidate: 3600,
      tags: [`project-${params.slug}`] 
    }
  }).then(res => res.json());
  
  return <ProjectDetails project={project} />;
}
```

#### Image Optimization Pipeline
```typescript
// Advanced image optimization with Next.js 15
interface ImageOptimization {
  formats: ['AVIF', 'WebP', 'JPEG'];
  sizes: {
    thumbnail: '300x200',
    card: '600x400', 
    hero: '1920x1080',
    mobile: '375x250'
  };
  quality: {
    high: 90,
    standard: 75,
    low: 60
  };
  loading: 'lazy' | 'eager' | 'priority';
  placeholder: 'blur' | 'empty';
}

// Implementation with optimized loading
import Image from 'next/image';
import { getPlaiceholder } from 'plaiceholder';

export async function OptimizedImage({ 
  src, 
  alt, 
  priority = false,
  sizes = "100vw" 
}: ImageProps) {
  const buffer = await fetch(src).then(async (res) =>
    Buffer.from(await res.arrayBuffer())
  );
  
  const { base64 } = await getPlaiceholder(buffer);
  
  return (
    <Image
      src={src}
      alt={alt}
      priority={priority}
      sizes={sizes}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL={base64}
      style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}
    />
  );
}
```

#### Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization
```typescript
// Advanced code splitting with React 19 + Next.js 15
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Component-level splitting
const ProjectVisualization = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/ProjectVisualization'),
  { 
    loading: () => <VisualizationSkeleton />,
    ssr: false // Client-side only for complex visualizations
  }
);

// Route-level splitting with preloading
const PortfolioSection = lazy(() => 
  import('@/components/portfolio/PortfolioSection')
    .then(module => ({ default: module.PortfolioSection }))
);

// Intelligent preloading based on user behavior
export function useIntelligentPreloading() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      (entries) => {
        entries.forEach((entry) => {
          if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            // Preload next likely component
            import('@/components/ContactForm');
          }
        });
      },
      { threshold: 0.1 }
    );
    
    const portfolioSection = document.getElementById('portfolio');
    if (portfolioSection) {
      observer.observe(portfolioSection);
    }
    
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);
}

// Bundle analysis configuration
const bundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
});

module.exports = bundleAnalyzer({
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
    swcMinify: true,
    modularizeImports: {
      'lucide-react': {
        transform: 'lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/{{member}}',
      },
    },
  },
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
  },
});
```

### 15.3 Performance Monitoring & Alerting

```typescript
// Real-time performance monitoring
interface PerformanceMonitoring {
  realUserMetrics: {
    provider: 'Vercel Speed Insights + Custom RUM';
    metrics: ['LCP', 'FID', 'CLS', 'TTFB', 'FCP'];
    sampling: '100% for errors, 10% for normal';
  };
  
  syntheticTesting: {
    provider: 'Lighthouse CI + Playwright';
    frequency: 'Every deployment + hourly';
    locations: ['US-East', 'EU-West', 'Asia-Pacific'];
  };
  
  alerting: {
    thresholds: {
      lcp: '>2.5s',
      fid: '>100ms', 
      cls: '>0.1',
      availability: '<99.9%'
    };
    channels: ['email', 'slack', 'pagerduty'];
  };
}

// Custom performance tracking
export function usePerformanceTracking() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Track custom metrics
    const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
      for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
        if (entry.entryType === 'navigation') {
          // Track page load metrics
          const metrics = {
            ttfb: entry.responseStart - entry.fetchStart,
            domContentLoaded: entry.domContentLoadedEventEnd - entry.fetchStart,
            loadComplete: entry.loadEventEnd - entry.fetchStart,
          };
          
          // Send to analytics
          sendMetrics('page-load', metrics);
        }
      }
    });
    
    observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['navigation', 'resource', 'paint'] });
    
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);
}
```
