# Task ID: 41
# Title: Visitor Intelligence and Personalization Engine with Real-Time Behavior Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 18, 30, 32, 38, 39
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive visitor intelligence and personalization engine with real-time behavior tracking, ML-based user segmentation, dynamic content adaptation, and automated A/B testing framework with GDPR compliance.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive visitor intelligence and personalization engine using real-time behavior tracking with Server-Sent Events and WebSocket connections for instant user interaction monitoring. Create ML-based user segmentation using TensorFlow.js for browser-based clustering algorithms including K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering based on visitor behavior patterns, session duration, page interactions, and engagement metrics. Implement dynamic content adaptation system using React context providers and custom hooks for real-time content personalization based on user segments, preferences, and behavioral patterns. Build privacy-compliant analytics infrastructure with GDPR consent management using cookie banners, data anonymization, and user data deletion capabilities. Create engagement prediction ML models using ONNX Runtime Web for browser-based inference with features including scroll depth, time on page, click patterns, and navigation behavior to predict conversion likelihood and engagement scores. Implement automated A/B testing framework with statistical significance testing using Bayesian methods, multivariate testing capabilities, and real-time results dashboard. Use Redis for real-time session storage and behavior caching, DynamoDB for persistent user profiles and segmentation data, and implement data pipeline for ML model training and updates. Integrate with existing analytics system for comprehensive visitor insights and create personalization API endpoints for content delivery optimization. Include privacy-first design with data minimization, consent management, and transparent data usage policies.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time behavior tracking accuracy by simulating user interactions and verifying event capture and processing. Validate ML-based user segmentation by testing clustering algorithms with synthetic user data and verifying segment accuracy and stability. Test dynamic content adaptation by creating multiple user personas and confirming appropriate content variations are served. Verify GDPR compliance by testing consent management flows, data anonymization processes, and user data deletion requests. Test engagement prediction models by comparing predicted scores with actual user behavior outcomes and measuring prediction accuracy. Validate A/B testing framework by running controlled experiments with known outcomes and verifying statistical significance calculations. Test privacy compliance by auditing data collection practices, consent mechanisms, and data retention policies. Perform load testing with 1000+ concurrent users to ensure real-time tracking performance and verify cross-browser compatibility for all personalization features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Real-Time Visitor Behavior Tracking Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a robust, privacy-first real-time tracking system using Server-Sent Events and WebSocket connections to capture and stream user interactions, session data, and engagement metrics across the Next.js 15 application.
### Details:
Integrate event listeners for scroll, click, navigation, and session events. Ensure data is streamed securely and efficiently to backend services using enterprise security patterns. Use Redis for real-time session storage and caching. Adhere to GDPR by anonymizing data at the point of collection.

## 2. Develop ML-Based User Segmentation and Engagement Prediction [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Build browser-based clustering and prediction models using TensorFlow.js and ONNX Runtime Web to segment users and predict engagement in real time based on tracked behavioral data.
### Details:
Implement K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering algorithms for segmentation. Train engagement prediction models using features like scroll depth, time on page, and click patterns. Store persistent user profiles and segmentation data in DynamoDB. Ensure models are lightweight for in-browser inference.

## 3. Create Dynamic Content Adaptation and Personalization Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.2
### Description: Design and implement a React 19-based dynamic content system using context providers and custom hooks to personalize content in real time according to user segments and behavioral patterns.
### Details:
Develop reusable personalization components and hooks. Integrate with the segmentation engine to adapt UI and content instantly. Expose personalization API endpoints for server-driven content optimization. Ensure seamless integration with existing analytics systems.

## 4. Implement Automated A/B and Multivariate Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.3
### Description: Build an automated testing framework supporting A/B and multivariate experiments with Bayesian statistical significance testing and a real-time results dashboard.
### Details:
Enable experiment definition, assignment, and tracking via API. Use Redis for fast experiment state management. Visualize results in a secure dashboard. Integrate with the personalization layer for seamless variant delivery.

## 5. Establish GDPR-Compliant Analytics and Consent Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Implement a privacy-first analytics infrastructure with GDPR consent management, including cookie banners, data minimization, anonymization, and user data deletion workflows.
### Details:
Integrate consent management platform (CMP) with Next.js middleware. Ensure all tracking and personalization logic respects user consent. Provide transparent data usage policies and user-facing data deletion tools. Regularly audit for compliance.
