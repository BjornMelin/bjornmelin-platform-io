# Task ID: 5
# Title: Tailwind CSS v4 Design System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement modern design system with Tailwind CSS v4's revolutionary CSS-first architecture and glassmorphism aesthetics
# Details:
Implement Tailwind CSS v4 using the new CSS-first approach with @import "tailwindcss" and @theme directive for design tokens. Leverage native CSS variables generation, enhanced variant composability, and CSS layers architecture. Build glassmorphism components with modern backdrop-filter effects, implement dark/light theme support using CSS custom properties, and integrate class-variance-authority for component variants. Utilize modern CSS features like color-mix() and @property for registered custom properties, ensuring optimal performance with smaller bundle sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive design across all breakpoints, verify theme switching functionality with CSS variables, validate glassmorphism effects with backdrop-filter across browsers, test enhanced variant composability features, and ensure accessibility compliance with color contrast ratios using modern CSS color functions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Tailwind CSS v4 Setup and Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Tailwind CSS v4 using the new CSS-first approach, configure with @import "tailwindcss", and verify enhanced variant composability features.
### Details:
Install Tailwind CSS v4 using `npm install tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next` and configure the new CSS-first approach by replacing tailwind.config.js with @import "tailwindcss" in global CSS. Implement the @theme directive for design tokens directly in CSS files. Set up the new Vite plugin for optimal performance and leverage native CSS variables that are automatically generated for all theme values. Test enhanced variant composability features like group-has-[&:focus]:opacity-100 to ensure the v4-specific functionality is working correctly.

## 2. CSS-First Design Tokens with @theme Directive [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Establish design tokens using Tailwind v4's @theme directive and CSS layers architecture, leveraging native CSS variables generation.
### Details:
Use @theme directive in CSS to define design tokens directly in stylesheets. Implement CSS layers (@layer theme, base, components, utilities) for proper cascade management. Leverage automatic CSS variables generation (--color-*, --spacing-*, --font-size-*) for all theme values. Integrate modern CSS features like color-mix() for dynamic color variations and @property for registered custom properties with type safety.

## 3. Modern Glassmorphism Components with CSS Backdrop-Filter [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Develop glassmorphism UI components using Tailwind v4's enhanced backdrop-filter utilities and modern CSS features.
### Details:
Create glassmorphism components (cards, modals, buttons) using Tailwind v4's improved backdrop-filter utilities. Implement modern CSS backdrop-filter effects with proper fallbacks. Use CSS custom properties for dynamic transparency and blur values. Ensure components leverage the new CSS-first architecture for optimal performance and smaller bundle sizes.

## 4. CSS Variables-Based Theme Switching [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Build theme switching system using Tailwind v4's native CSS variables and modern CSS color functions.
### Details:
Implement theme switching using CSS custom properties generated by Tailwind v4. Use color-mix() for dynamic theme variations and smooth transitions. Leverage CSS layers for theme overrides and ensure proper cascade management. Implement secure persistence with localStorage and system preference detection.

## 5. Class-Variance-Authority Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Integrate class-variance-authority (CVA) for type-safe component variants that work seamlessly with Tailwind v4's CSS-first approach.
### Details:
Set up class-variance-authority for managing component variants with TypeScript support. Create variant recipes that leverage Tailwind v4's enhanced variant composability. Ensure CVA patterns work optimally with the new CSS-first architecture and native CSS variables.

## 6. Enhanced Spacing and Typography with CSS Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Define fluid spacing and typography scales using Tailwind v4's CSS-first approach and modern CSS functions.
### Details:
Implement fluid typography using clamp() functions within @theme directive. Create harmonious spacing scales using CSS custom properties and modern CSS math functions. Document usage patterns for the new CSS-first design token system and ensure compatibility with enhanced variant composability.

## 7. Performance-Optimized Animation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Set up animation system leveraging Tailwind v4's CSS-first architecture for optimal performance and smaller bundle sizes.
### Details:
Define animation tokens using @theme directive and CSS custom properties. Implement performant animations using CSS layers and modern CSS features. Leverage the performance benefits of Tailwind v4's CSS-first approach to reduce JavaScript bundle size while maintaining rich animation capabilities.

## 8. Advanced Component Variants with Enhanced Composability [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.5, 5.6
### Description: Implement component variant system using Tailwind v4's enhanced variant composability and CSS layers.
### Details:
Use enhanced variant composability features like group-has-[&:focus]:opacity-100 for complex component states. Implement variant management using CSS layers and custom properties. Create maintainable component patterns that leverage both CVA and Tailwind v4's native variant system.

## 9. Modern CSS Accessibility and Performance Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4, 5.8
### Description: Validate accessibility using modern CSS color functions and test performance benefits of CSS-first architecture.
### Details:
Use modern CSS color functions like color-mix() for accessible color variations. Validate WCAG compliance with enhanced color contrast using CSS custom properties. Test performance improvements from CSS-first architecture including smaller bundle sizes and faster runtime performance. Integrate accessibility checks for enhanced variant composability features.
