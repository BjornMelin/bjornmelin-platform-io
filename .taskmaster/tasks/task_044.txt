# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25, 26, 7, 39, 19, 20, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive SEO optimization engine with AI-powered meta content generation, automatic schema markup, dynamic sitemap generation, Core Web Vitals optimization, and automated A/B testing for meta descriptions.
# Details:
Implement enterprise-grade SEO optimization engine using Next.js 15 metadata API with React 19 Server Components for optimal SEO performance. Create AI-powered meta content generation using OpenAI GPT-4o and Claude 4 Sonnet dual-model validation for title tags, meta descriptions, and OpenGraph content with automatic keyword optimization and readability scoring. Implement automatic JSON-LD structured data generation for Organization, Person, WebSite, and BreadcrumbList schemas with dynamic content adaptation. Build Core Web Vitals optimization system monitoring LCP, FID, CLS with real-time performance tracking and automated optimization suggestions. Create dynamic XML sitemap generation with priority scoring, change frequency detection, and automatic submission to search engines. Implement Google Search Console API integration for rank tracking, click-through rate analysis, and search query optimization. Build automated A/B testing framework for meta descriptions with statistical significance testing and performance correlation analysis. Create competitor analysis dashboard using SEMrush/Ahrefs APIs for keyword gap analysis, content opportunity identification, and ranking comparison. Implement content freshness monitoring with automated update suggestions based on search trends and performance data. Build keyword density optimization engine with semantic keyword analysis, LSI keyword suggestions, and content optimization workflows. Create readability scoring system using Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, and custom algorithms with improvement recommendations. Implement automated content optimization workflows triggered by performance degradation, search ranking changes, or content age thresholds.

# Test Strategy:
Test Next.js 15 metadata API integration by verifying proper meta tag generation, OpenGraph, and Twitter Cards across different page types. Validate AI-powered content generation by comparing GPT-4o and Claude 4 Sonnet outputs for consistency and quality. Test JSON-LD structured data using Google's Rich Results Test and Schema.org validator. Monitor Core Web Vitals improvements using Lighthouse CI and real user monitoring data. Verify dynamic sitemap generation accuracy and search engine submission success. Test Search Console API integration with rank tracking accuracy and data synchronization. Validate A/B testing framework statistical significance calculations and meta description performance correlation. Test competitor analysis dashboard data accuracy and API rate limiting. Verify content freshness monitoring triggers and optimization workflow execution. Test keyword density optimization recommendations and readability scoring accuracy across various content types.
