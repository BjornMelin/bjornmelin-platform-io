Implement React 19's async scripts with automatic deduplication and cache() API for optimized data fetching. Configure Next.js 15 with Turbopack for significantly faster build times and Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Set up sophisticated caching layers including HTTP caching with proper Cache-Control headers, Redis caching for API responses, and browser caching with service workers. Implement 2025 Core Web Vitals optimizations targeting LCP under 1.8s through advanced image optimization, CLS under 0.1 with proper aspect ratios and skeleton loading, and INP under 150ms (replacing FID) with React 19's concurrent rendering and improved error boundaries. Configure Lighthouse CI integration with Web Vitals library v4 for automated performance monitoring including new INP metric and improved attribution. Add React 19's improved Profiler for real-time performance monitoring, automated alerts for performance degradation, and detailed performance reports with actionable recommendations.

# Test Strategy:

Verify React 19's Actions API effectiveness for form submissions, test use() API performance improvements for promise handling, validate cache() API optimization for data fetching. Test Next.js 15 Turbopack integration for build performance improvements and HMR speed. Verify React 19's enhanced Suspense streaming optimizations, test async scripts deduplication effectiveness, validate document metadata handling performance gains. Run automated Lighthouse audits in CI/CD pipeline with 2025 performance budget enforcement, test performance regression detection with threshold alerts, verify real-time monitoring accuracy with React 19's enhanced Profiler and Web Vitals v4 attribution data.
