### Description: Integrate an A/B testing platform (e.g., Google Optimize, Optimizely) to run controlled experiments on key pages and features. Ensure tests are statistically sound and results are actionable.
### Details:
Use feature flags for low-complexity rollouts, document test hypotheses, and automate experiment result analysis for maintainability.

## 5. Deploy Feedback Collection Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.4
### Description: Implement feedback widgets, surveys, and in-app prompts to gather qualitative user insights. Integrate with customer support channels for real-time issue reporting.
### Details:
Ensure accessibility, minimize user friction, and securely store feedback data. Use the latest libraries for survey and widget integration.

## 6. Automate Review and Iteration Processes [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.5
### Description: Set up automated workflows for regular review of analytics, feedback, and test results. Schedule sprint-based optimization cycles and document all changes for traceability.
### Details:
Leverage CI/CD pipelines for deployment, use version control best practices, and automate notifications for review cycles.

## 7. Track and Report Success Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define KPIs (e.g., retention, engagement, conversion rate) and automate dashboard reporting for stakeholders. Regularly benchmark against industry standards and historical data.
### Details:
Use secure, role-based access for dashboards, ensure data integrity, and document metric definitions for ongoing maintainability.
