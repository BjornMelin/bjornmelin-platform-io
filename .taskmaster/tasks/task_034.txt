# Task ID: 34
# Title: Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation with Vitest, Playwright E2E Testing, Storybook Component Testing, and CI/CD Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 25, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive testing infrastructure with Vitest for unit/integration testing, Playwright for cross-browser E2E testing, Storybook for component testing, and CI/CD integration targeting 80%+ code coverage.
# Details:
Set up comprehensive testing framework using Vitest v2 for unit and integration tests with TypeScript support, MSW for API mocking, and @testing-library/react for component testing. Implement Playwright v1.40+ for cross-browser E2E testing across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with parallel execution and visual regression testing using percy.io or Chromatic. Configure Storybook v8 with Component Story Format 3.0 for isolated component testing, interaction testing with @storybook/test, and accessibility testing with @storybook/addon-a11y. Create comprehensive test coverage including: unit tests for utility functions and hooks (90%+ coverage), integration tests for API routes and database operations, component tests for all UI components with various props and states, E2E tests for critical user journeys (contact form submission, navigation, responsive design), visual regression tests for design system components, and accessibility tests ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions including automated test execution on PR creation, code coverage reporting with codecov.io, visual regression testing in staging environment, performance testing with Lighthouse CI, and automated deployment blocking on test failures. Configure test environments with proper environment variables, database seeding for integration tests, and parallel test execution for faster CI/CD cycles. Implement test utilities including custom render functions with providers, mock factories for complex data structures, and shared test fixtures for consistent testing data.

# Test Strategy:
Verify 80%+ code coverage across all modules using Vitest coverage reports and codecov integration. Test Playwright E2E scenarios across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers including contact form submission, navigation flows, responsive design breakpoints, and accessibility compliance. Validate Storybook component stories render correctly with all prop variations and interaction states. Test CI/CD pipeline by creating pull requests and verifying automated test execution, coverage reporting, and deployment blocking on failures. Perform visual regression testing by comparing component screenshots across different browsers and screen sizes. Validate accessibility testing by running axe-core tests and ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance scores. Test performance benchmarks using Lighthouse CI and ensure Core Web Vitals meet target thresholds. Verify test environment setup by running tests locally and in CI with proper database seeding and environment variable configuration.
