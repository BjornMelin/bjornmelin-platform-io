# Task ID: 25
# Title: Next.js 15 and React 19 Framework Upgrade with TypeScript 5.8.4 Migration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Upgrade the entire project to Next.js 15.3.4, React 19, and TypeScript 5.8.4 while migrating from npm to pnpm package manager for improved performance and dependency management. This upgrade leverages cutting-edge 2025 features including stable Turbopack, React 19's Actions API, enhanced Suspense, and new concurrent rendering capabilities.
# Details:
Perform comprehensive framework upgrade starting with package manager migration from npm to pnpm for faster installs and better disk space efficiency. Upgrade Next.js to 15.3.4 with stable Turbopack support (now faster than Webpack), enhanced App Router optimizations, and new Promise-based params/searchParams patterns. Migrate React to version 19 leveraging the new Actions API for simplified form handling, the `use` API for reading promises and context in render, enhanced Suspense with automatic batching improvements, and new Context as Provider syntax. Update TypeScript to 5.8.4 for improved type inference, better performance, and new language features. Implement React 19's async scripts support with automatic deduplication, improved document metadata handling allowing <title> and <meta> tags in components, and startTransition enhancements for better concurrent rendering. Configure pnpm workspace for 2025 best practices, update CI/CD pipelines to use pnpm, and ensure all build scripts are compatible. Address React 19 breaking changes including new JSX transform requirements, updated lifecycle methods, improved error boundaries, and new root options. Update TypeScript configurations for new compiler options, strict mode enhancements, and improved module resolution. Test all existing functionality including form validation with Actions API, API routes, and component rendering to ensure compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful package manager migration by confirming pnpm lockfile generation and workspace configuration. Test Next.js 15.3.4 features including stable Turbopack build performance, App Router functionality, server components rendering, and Promise-based params/searchParams. Validate React 19 features including Actions API for form handling, `use` API for promise/context reading, enhanced Suspense behavior, Context as Provider syntax, async scripts with deduplication, and document metadata handling. Confirm TypeScript 5.8.4 compilation with no type errors and improved inference. Test startTransition enhancements and concurrent rendering optimizations. Verify build process completes successfully with Turbopack optimizations and improved bundle sizes. Test development server startup and hot reload functionality with enhanced performance. Validate production build and deployment process with 2025 CI/CD best practices. Confirm all existing tests pass with updated framework versions and new error boundary improvements. Test cross-browser compatibility and performance metrics to ensure significant performance gains from Turbopack and React 19 optimizations.
