# Task ID: 33
# Title: CloudWatch Monitoring, CI/CD Pipelines, and Blue-Green Deployment Automation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28, 29, 30, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive AWS CloudWatch monitoring dashboards, automated CI/CD pipelines with blue-green deployment strategies, and infrastructure monitoring with intelligent alerting for production-grade observability.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive monitoring and deployment automation infrastructure using AWS CloudWatch, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy. Create CloudWatch dashboards with custom metrics for application performance, infrastructure health, and business KPIs including response times, error rates, memory/CPU utilization, and user engagement metrics. Set up CloudWatch Logs aggregation with structured logging, log insights queries, and automated log retention policies. Configure CloudWatch Alarms with SNS notifications for critical thresholds including 5xx errors >1%, response time >2s, and memory utilization >80%. Implement AWS CodePipeline with multi-stage deployment including source (GitHub), build (CodeBuild with Docker), test (automated testing suite), and deploy stages. Configure blue-green deployment strategy using AWS CodeDeploy with Application Load Balancer traffic shifting, automated rollback triggers on CloudWatch alarm breaches, and zero-downtime deployments. Set up infrastructure monitoring using CloudWatch Container Insights for ECS/Fargate, X-Ray distributed tracing for microservices, and AWS Config for compliance monitoring. Create custom CloudWatch metrics for business logic using embedded metric format (EMF) in Lambda functions. Implement automated scaling policies based on CloudWatch metrics with predictive scaling for traffic patterns. Configure cross-region monitoring for disaster recovery scenarios and implement automated backup verification monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CloudWatch dashboard creation and metric visualization by deploying test workloads and confirming real-time data display. Test alarm functionality by artificially triggering threshold breaches and validating SNS notification delivery. Validate CI/CD pipeline by pushing code changes and monitoring automated build, test, and deployment progression through all stages. Test blue-green deployment by deploying application updates and verifying traffic shifting occurs without service interruption, including rollback scenarios triggered by health check failures. Verify infrastructure monitoring by checking Container Insights data collection, X-Ray trace generation for API calls, and AWS Config rule compliance status. Test custom metrics emission using CloudWatch PutMetricData API and validate EMF log parsing. Validate automated scaling by generating load tests and confirming scale-out/scale-in events based on CloudWatch metrics. Test cross-region monitoring setup and disaster recovery alerting mechanisms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design CloudWatch Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create application and workload-specific CloudWatch dashboards that focus on key metrics and resources for every critical application or workload, incorporating cross-service and cross-account observability.

## 2. Implement Log Aggregation [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Set up centralized log aggregation using AWS CloudWatch Logs and ensure logs from all relevant services and applications are collected and retained securely.
### Details:
Configure log groups and streams, enforce retention policies, and enable encryption at rest and in transit. Use the latest CloudWatch Agent version for enhanced capabilities and compatibility. Ensure logs are structured for efficient querying and analysis.

## 3. Configure Alarm Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1, 33.2
### Description: Define and implement CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics and log patterns, including thresholds for warnings, errors, and critical events.
### Details:
Utilize metric filters for log-based alarms, set up multi-region and cross-account alarms as needed, and integrate with notification systems (SNS, email, Slack). Follow best practices for alarm noise reduction and actionable alerting.

## 4. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a secure and maintainable CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, integrating with version control and artifact repositories.
### Details:
Implement pipeline stages for build, test, deploy, and post-deployment verification. Use the latest pipeline features, enforce least-privilege IAM roles, and enable pipeline notifications for visibility and auditability.

## 5. Implement Blue-Green Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.4
### Description: Configure blue-green deployment strategies within the CI/CD pipeline to minimize downtime and risk during application updates.
### Details:
Leverage AWS CodeDeploy or Elastic Beanstalk blue-green deployment features. Automate traffic shifting, health checks, and rollback triggers. Ensure rollback paths are tested and documented.

## 6. Automate Rollback Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.5
### Description: Develop and integrate automated rollback mechanisms in the deployment pipeline to ensure rapid recovery from failed deployments.
### Details:
Implement automated rollback triggers based on health checks, alarms, or failed tests. Ensure rollback actions are logged and auditable. Test rollback procedures regularly.

## 7. Establish Infrastructure Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1, 33.2, 33.3
### Description: Monitor infrastructure components (EC2, RDS, Lambda, networking) using CloudWatch metrics, custom metrics, and third-party integrations as needed.
### Details:
Deploy the latest CloudWatch Agent for enhanced metric collection. Monitor resource utilization, availability, and performance. Set up dashboards and alarms for infrastructure health.

## 8. Define and Apply Scaling Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure auto-scaling policies for compute and database resources based on real-time metrics and predictive analytics.
### Details:
Use AWS Auto Scaling and Application Auto Scaling with CloudWatch alarms as triggers. Ensure scaling policies are cost-effective, secure, and tested for reliability under load.

## 9. Implement Cross-Region Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1, 33.2, 33.3, 33.4, 33.5, 33.6, 33.7, 33.8
### Description: Enable cross-region monitoring, deployment, and failover capabilities to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.
### Details:
