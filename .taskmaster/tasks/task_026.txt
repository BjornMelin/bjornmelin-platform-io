# Task ID: 26
# Title: App Router Migration with Server Components Conversion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate from Next.js pages directory to Next.js 15 app directory structure with React 19 Server Components, implementing modern async rendering patterns, Promise-based params/searchParams with the `use` hook, and advanced streaming SSR capabilities.
# Details:
Perform comprehensive migration from pages directory to Next.js 15 app directory structure, converting all pages to React 19 Server Components with async rendering patterns and Client Components where interactivity is required. Implement Promise-based params and searchParams using React 19's `use` hook for proper async parameter handling. Create proper layout hierarchy with root layout.tsx, nested layouts using React 19's new Context as Provider syntax, and loading.tsx/error.tsx files with enhanced streaming error boundaries. Migrate API routes from pages/api to app/api route handlers using React 19's Actions API and Server Actions. Convert data fetching from getServerSideProps/getStaticProps to native async Server Components with React 19's cache() API and Next.js 15's improved caching strategies. Implement React 19's document metadata handling with <title> and <meta> components directly in Server Components, replacing generateMetadata where appropriate. Update file-based routing to match new app directory conventions with proper streaming SSR and Suspense boundaries. Convert dynamic routes to use new [slug] and [...slug] patterns with Promise-based parameter access. Implement React 19's enhanced Suspense boundaries with streaming improvements and use the `use` API for reading promises in both Server and Client Components. Integrate Turbopack for faster development builds and leverage React 19's startTransition enhancements for non-blocking navigation. Ensure proper TypeScript 5.8.4 integration with new Promise-based patterns and React 19's improved error boundaries for robust streaming error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all pages render correctly with React 19 Server Components and async patterns, test Promise-based params/searchParams with `use` hook functionality, validate Server Components properly use cache() API and streaming SSR, confirm Client Components maintain interactivity with React 19 features, test layout hierarchy with new Context as Provider syntax, verify React 19 document metadata components work correctly for SEO, test enhanced Suspense boundaries and streaming error handling, validate API route handlers with Actions API respond correctly, test Turbopack integration improves development performance, ensure startTransition provides non-blocking navigation, verify `use` API works correctly for promise reading, validate TypeScript 5.8.4 compilation with Promise-based patterns, and conduct comprehensive streaming and error boundary testing across all routes.
