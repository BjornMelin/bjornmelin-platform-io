# Task ID: 31
# Title: AWS Lambda Functions and API Gateway Setup for Serverless Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive serverless microservices architecture using AWS Lambda functions with API Gateway integration, including route handlers, error handling, and database connectivity for scalable backend services.
# Details:
Implement complete serverless backend infrastructure using AWS CDK v2 for Infrastructure as Code deployment. Create AWS Lambda functions with Node.js 20.x runtime for microservices including user management, contact form processing, content delivery, and analytics services. Configure API Gateway REST API with custom domain integration, request/response transformations, and CORS configuration for frontend connectivity. Implement Lambda function handlers with proper error handling, input validation using Zod schemas, and structured logging with AWS CloudWatch. Set up Lambda layers for shared dependencies including database clients (DynamoDB SDK, Redis client), validation libraries, and utility functions. Configure Lambda environment variables for database connections, API keys, and configuration settings with AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store integration. Implement proper IAM roles and policies following least privilege principle for Lambda execution, DynamoDB access, S3 operations, and CloudWatch logging. Create API Gateway resource paths for /api/contact, /api/projects, /api/analytics with appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Configure API Gateway request validation, rate limiting (1000 requests per minute), and usage plans for different client tiers. Implement Lambda function cold start optimization using provisioned concurrency for critical endpoints and connection pooling for database connections. Set up API Gateway custom authorizers for protected endpoints, implement JWT token validation, and configure CORS policies for cross-origin requests. Create comprehensive error handling with custom error classes, standardized error responses, and proper HTTP status codes. Implement database integration patterns with DynamoDB using single-table design, connection pooling, and query optimization. Configure Lambda function monitoring with CloudWatch metrics, custom dashboards, and alerting for error rates and performance thresholds.

# Test Strategy:
Test Lambda function deployment and execution using AWS CLI invoke commands with various payload scenarios. Verify API Gateway endpoint accessibility and response formats using Postman or curl commands for all HTTP methods. Test error handling by triggering various error conditions including invalid inputs, database connection failures, and timeout scenarios. Validate CORS configuration by making cross-origin requests from different domains and verifying response headers. Test rate limiting by exceeding configured thresholds and verifying 429 Too Many Requests responses. Verify Lambda function performance with load testing using Artillery or similar tools, monitoring cold start times and execution duration. Test database integration by performing CRUD operations and verifying data consistency in DynamoDB tables. Validate IAM permissions by testing Lambda function access to required AWS services and ensuring least privilege compliance. Test API Gateway custom authorizers with valid and invalid JWT tokens, verifying proper authentication and authorization flows. Monitor CloudWatch logs for proper structured logging and verify custom metrics are being recorded correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Lambda Function Requirements and Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify the business logic, input/output contracts, and break down functionality into small, single-purpose Lambda functions following microservices best practices.
### Details:
Ensure each function has a clear, focused responsibility to improve maintainability and security. Document requirements and expected behaviors for each function.[5]

## 2. Set Up AWS Lambda Functions Using Latest Runtimes [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Create Lambda functions using the latest supported runtime (e.g., Python 3.12, Node.js 20), ensuring compatibility with modern libraries and AWS features.
### Details:
Leverage AWS SAM or Serverless Framework for infrastructure as code. Use minimal dependencies and optimize memory allocation based on function needs for cost and performance.[5]

## 3. Configure API Gateway for Secure and Scalable Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Set up API Gateway to expose Lambda functions as RESTful or HTTP endpoints, applying best practices for security, throttling, and CORS.
### Details:
Implement usage plans, rate limiting, and request validation. Use custom domain names and enable logging for API Gateway.[1][4]

## 4. Implement Route Handlers and Mapping Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.3
### Description: Define route handlers in API Gateway to map HTTP methods and paths to corresponding Lambda functions, using mapping templates for request/response transformation.
### Details:
Ensure clear separation of concerns and maintainability by keeping route logic minimal in Lambda handlers.[1]

## 5. Integrate Robust Error Handling and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.4
### Description: Implement structured error handling in Lambda functions and configure API Gateway to return standardized error responses.
### Details:
Set up centralized logging using AWS CloudWatch. Ensure all errors are logged with sufficient context for troubleshooting and audit trails.[5]

## 6. Add Input Validation and Schema Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.5
### Description: Incorporate input validation at both API Gateway (using request models) and within Lambda functions to prevent malformed or malicious requests.
### Details:
Use JSON Schema or similar validation libraries. Reject invalid requests early to reduce unnecessary Lambda invocations and improve security.[4][5]

## 7. Create and Attach Shared Lambda Layers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop shared Lambda Layers for common dependencies, utilities, or SDKs to promote code reuse and reduce deployment package size.
### Details:
Ensure layers use the latest library versions and are versioned for traceability. Document usage and update procedures.[5]

## 8. Configure Environment Variables and Secrets Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up environment variables for configuration and integrate AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for sensitive data.
### Details:
Follow best practices for separating configuration from code and never hard-code secrets. Use IAM policies to restrict access to secrets.[4][5]

## 9. Define and Apply IAM Roles and Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create fine-grained IAM roles for each Lambda function, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
### Details:
Audit permissions regularly and use managed policies where possible. Document all IAM roles and their intended access.[5]

## 10. Implement Monitoring, Alerts, and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable CloudWatch metrics, logs, and alarms for Lambda and API Gateway. Continuously monitor performance and optimize memory, timeout, and concurrency settings.
### Details:
Set up dashboards and automated alerts for errors, latency, and cost anomalies. Regularly review logs and metrics to identify optimization opportunities.[4][5]
