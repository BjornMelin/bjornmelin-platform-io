# Task ID: 35
# Title: Pre-launch Security and Performance Auditing with Automated Penetration Testing, Performance Validation, and Comprehensive Audit Reporting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32, 27, 34, 20, 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive pre-launch security and performance auditing including automated penetration testing, Core Web Vitals validation, security vulnerability scanning, and detailed audit reporting to ensure production readiness.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive pre-launch auditing infrastructure using automated security and performance testing tools. Set up OWASP ZAP for automated penetration testing including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and authentication bypass testing with custom scan policies targeting the application's specific attack surface. Configure Nessus or OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning of infrastructure components, SSL/TLS configuration analysis using SSL Labs API, and dependency vulnerability scanning with npm audit and Snyk. Implement performance auditing using Lighthouse CI with custom performance budgets, WebPageTest API for real-world performance testing across multiple locations and devices, and Core Web Vitals monitoring with thresholds (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1). Create automated security testing pipeline using GitHub Actions with SAST tools like CodeQL, SonarQube for code quality and security analysis, and container scanning with Trivy for Docker images. Set up comprehensive audit reporting with automated PDF generation using Puppeteer, security findings aggregation with CVSS scoring, performance metrics trending analysis, and compliance validation against OWASP Top 10, GDPR requirements, and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA). Implement pre-production environment testing with production-like data volumes, load testing using Artillery.js or k6 for stress testing under expected traffic patterns, and database performance analysis. Configure automated alerting for critical security findings, performance regressions, and compliance violations with integration to Slack/email notifications.

# Test Strategy:
Verify penetration testing effectiveness by confirming OWASP ZAP detects intentionally introduced vulnerabilities and validates WAF protection mechanisms. Test performance auditing accuracy by comparing Lighthouse CI results with manual testing and validating Core Web Vitals measurements against real user monitoring data. Validate security scanning completeness by ensuring all application endpoints, infrastructure components, and dependencies are properly scanned with no false negatives. Test audit report generation by confirming PDF reports contain all required sections including executive summary, detailed findings, remediation recommendations, and compliance status. Verify automated pipeline execution by triggering full audit suite and confirming all tests complete within acceptable timeframes (< 30 minutes). Test alerting mechanisms by simulating critical security findings and performance regressions to ensure proper notification delivery and escalation procedures.
