# Task ID: 10
# Title: Professional Timeline and Skills Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create interactive career timeline with dynamic skills progression tracking
# Details:
Build scrollable timeline with smooth animations using Framer Motion, implement clickable milestones for detailed views, create skills progression visualization with proficiency indicators, and add AI-generated career narrative. Include certification tracking with real-time AWS certification status, achievement highlights, and interactive skill matrix. Use modern data visualization libraries like D3.js or Recharts for compelling visual representations.

# Test Strategy:
Test timeline scrolling and animations, verify milestone interactions, validate skills visualization accuracy, test responsive behavior across devices, and ensure smooth performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Timeline UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a responsive, accessible timeline UI component using the latest stable version of a modern UI library (e.g., React 19, Material UI v6). Ensure semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and ARIA roles for accessibility. Apply enterprise-grade theming and modular CSS for maintainability.
### Details:
Use TypeScript for type safety. Follow best practices for component isolation and reusability. Integrate security measures to prevent XSS and injection attacks in dynamic content rendering.

## 2. Setup Timeline Animation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Integrate a performant animation library (e.g., Framer Motion v11 or GSAP 3.x) to animate timeline transitions, milestone reveals, and user interactions. Ensure animations are smooth, interruptible, and respect user motion preferences.
### Details:
Optimize for low CPU/GPU usage. Use declarative animation APIs for maintainability. Provide fallbacks for reduced motion settings to meet accessibility standards.

## 3. Implement Milestone Interactivity [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Enable interactive milestones on the timeline, supporting click, hover, and keyboard events. Display contextual details, progress, and actions (e.g., edit, comment, attach files) in secure, accessible popovers or modals.
### Details:
Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Use role-based access controls for milestone actions. Ensure all interactions are testable and covered by unit/integration tests.

## 4. Develop Skills Matrix Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build a dynamic, filterable skills matrix using a robust data visualization library (e.g., D3.js v8, ECharts 5.x). Support grouping, sorting, and color-coding by skill category, proficiency, and recency.
### Details:
Ensure matrix is responsive and accessible. Use lazy loading for large datasets. Follow best practices for data privacy and secure rendering of sensitive skill data.

## 5. Integrate AI Narrative Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Implement AI-powered narrative generation for timeline and skills highlights using a secure, rate-limited API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o or Azure OpenAI). Allow user customization of tone, style, and audience per best practices.
### Details:
Follow prompt engineering best practices: include audience/context, allow style/tone selection, and support creativity level adjustments. Log and monitor AI usage for compliance and abuse prevention.

## 6. Certification Tracking Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3
### Description: Develop a secure module for tracking certifications, including upload, verification, expiry reminders, and integration with timeline milestones. Support enterprise-grade encryption for sensitive documents.
### Details:
Implement RBAC for certification data. Use secure file storage (e.g., AWS S3 with encryption). Provide audit logs for all certification actions.

## 7. Advanced Data Visualization and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4, 10.6
### Description: Create advanced, exportable data visualizations (charts, graphs, heatmaps) for skills progression, milestone completion, and certification status. Support PDF/CSV export and real-time dashboard updates.
### Details:
Use latest charting libraries with accessibility support. Ensure all exports are sanitized and secure. Provide customizable filters and drill-down capabilities for enterprise reporting.
