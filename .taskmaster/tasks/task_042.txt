# Task ID: 42
# Title: Enterprise-Grade Error Boundary and Real-time Monitoring System with Sentry Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25, 26, 27, 18, 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive error boundary and monitoring system with Sentry integration, automatic error recovery, real-time alerting, performance degradation detection, and automated incident response workflows using React 19 error boundaries.
# Details:
Implement enterprise-grade error boundary and monitoring system using React 19's enhanced error boundaries with automatic fallback UI and error recovery mechanisms. Integrate Sentry SDK v8+ for comprehensive error tracking with custom error classification, user session correlation, and performance monitoring. Create React 19 error boundaries using the new error handling patterns with automatic retry mechanisms, graceful degradation strategies, and user-friendly fallback components with recovery actions.

Implement real-time monitoring dashboard using Server-Sent Events for live error tracking, performance metrics visualization, and incident status updates. Create error classification system with severity levels (critical, high, medium, low), automatic error grouping by stack trace similarity, and intelligent error routing based on component hierarchy and user impact. Integrate AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure monitoring with custom metrics for application health, error rates, response times, and resource utilization.

Build automated incident response workflows with multi-channel alerting via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and SMS notifications based on error severity and escalation policies. Implement performance regression detection using statistical analysis of Core Web Vitals metrics, automatic baseline establishment, and anomaly detection algorithms. Create comprehensive error analytics dashboard with real-time charts, error trend analysis, user impact assessment, and resolution tracking.

Configure Sentry with custom error boundaries, breadcrumb tracking, user context enrichment, and release tracking for deployment correlation. Implement error recovery strategies including component-level retry mechanisms, state restoration, and progressive enhancement fallbacks. Add performance degradation detection with automatic alerts for LCP regression >10%, CLS spikes >0.1, and INP increases >50ms from baseline.

Integrate with existing AWS infrastructure including CloudWatch Logs aggregation, Lambda function error tracking, and DynamoDB performance monitoring. Create error correlation engine linking frontend errors with backend failures, user sessions with error patterns, and deployment events with error spikes. Implement automated error reporting with context-rich notifications including user agent, session replay, and component state snapshots.

# Test Strategy:
Test React 19 error boundary functionality by intentionally triggering JavaScript errors in different components and verifying fallback UI rendering with recovery options. Validate Sentry integration by generating test errors and confirming proper error capture, classification, and dashboard visualization. Test real-time monitoring by simulating various error scenarios and verifying Server-Sent Events delivery of error notifications and performance metrics.

Verify error classification accuracy by testing different error types (network failures, JavaScript exceptions, React errors) and confirming proper severity assignment and routing. Test automated incident response by triggering critical errors and validating multi-channel alert delivery timing and escalation workflows. Validate performance regression detection by artificially degrading Core Web Vitals metrics and confirming automatic baseline comparison and anomaly alerts.

Test error recovery mechanisms by triggering recoverable errors and verifying automatic retry functionality, state restoration, and user experience continuity. Validate AWS CloudWatch integration by checking custom metric publication, log aggregation, and alarm functionality. Test error correlation engine by creating linked frontend/backend errors and verifying proper association in analytics dashboard.

Conduct load testing to verify monitoring system performance under high error volumes, test alert rate limiting and deduplication, and validate dashboard responsiveness with real-time data streams. Test cross-browser compatibility of error boundaries and monitoring functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Verify GDPR compliance for error data collection and user session tracking with proper consent management and data retention policies.
