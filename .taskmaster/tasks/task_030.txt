# Task ID: 30
# Title: DynamoDB and S3 Storage Setup with Redis Caching Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive data storage infrastructure with DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, and Redis cluster for caching, including data modeling schemas and optimized configurations.
# Details:
Implement complete data storage infrastructure using AWS CDK v2 for Infrastructure as Code deployment. Create DynamoDB tables with optimized partition/sort key design for user data, content metadata, and application state with Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) for efficient querying patterns. Configure DynamoDB with on-demand billing, point-in-time recovery, and encryption at rest using AWS KMS. Set up S3 buckets with intelligent tiering for static assets, user uploads, and backup storage with lifecycle policies for cost optimization. Implement S3 bucket policies with least privilege access, enable versioning and cross-region replication for disaster recovery. Deploy Redis ElastiCache cluster with Multi-AZ configuration for session storage, application caching, and real-time data. Create Redis cluster with automatic failover, backup retention, and encryption in transit/at rest. Design comprehensive data modeling schemas including user profiles, content entities, and caching strategies with TTL policies. Implement data access patterns with AWS SDK v3, connection pooling, and error handling. Configure CloudWatch monitoring for all storage services with custom metrics and alarms for performance optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify DynamoDB table creation with correct partition/sort keys and GSI configuration using AWS CLI describe-table commands. Test DynamoDB read/write operations with various access patterns and validate query performance. Confirm S3 bucket policies and lifecycle rules using AWS CLI and test file upload/download operations with different file types and sizes. Validate Redis cluster connectivity and failover scenarios by testing cache operations and monitoring cluster health. Test data modeling schemas by performing CRUD operations and validating data integrity across all storage layers. Monitor CloudWatch metrics for latency, throughput, and error rates to ensure optimal performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. DynamoDB Table Design and Schema Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design DynamoDB tables using single-table or multi-table strategies, define partition and sort keys, and plan for scalability and maintainability. Incorporate best practices for minimizing the number of tables and optimizing for access patterns.
### Details:
Follow AWS recommendations to minimize table count, use well-distributed partition keys to avoid hot partitions, and consider control plane limits. Validate design with AWS solution architects for multi-tenant or complex scenarios. Reference latest DynamoDB documentation and best practices.

## 2. DynamoDB Data Modeling and Indexing [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Model data for efficient access, define item collections, and implement Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) and Local Secondary Indexes (LSIs) as needed for query flexibility.
### Details:
Apply single-table design patterns, use GSIs strategically to support critical access patterns, and avoid unnecessary indexes to control costs. Ensure data modeling supports current and future business requirements.

## 3. S3 Bucket Setup and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure S3 buckets for storage, ensuring naming conventions, versioning, and lifecycle policies are in place.
### Details:
Enable versioning for data durability, configure lifecycle rules for cost optimization, and set up logging for auditability. Use latest AWS SDKs and follow S3 best practices for security and performance.

## 4. Redis Cluster Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy a Redis cluster using AWS ElastiCache or a managed Redis solution, ensuring high availability and scalability.
### Details:
Configure cluster mode for partitioning, enable automatic failover, and use the latest Redis version. Apply security best practices such as encryption in transit and at rest, and restrict access via security groups.

## 5. Access Policies and Security Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Define and implement IAM policies, bucket policies, and security groups to control access to DynamoDB, S3, and Redis resources.
### Details:
Apply least privilege principles, use resource-based policies for S3, and configure VPC endpoints where appropriate. Regularly review and audit permissions for compliance and security.

## 6. Backup, Replication, and Disaster Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Implement backup and replication strategies for DynamoDB, S3, and Redis to ensure data durability and business continuity.
### Details:
Enable DynamoDB point-in-time recovery and consider global tables for multi-region replication. Use S3 cross-region replication and lifecycle policies. For Redis, configure snapshotting and multi-AZ replication.

## 7. Monitoring and Observability [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting for all storage services to ensure operational visibility and rapid incident response.
### Details:
Integrate with AWS CloudWatch for metrics and alarms, enable DynamoDB Streams for change data capture, and configure S3 access logs. Monitor Redis performance and set up alerts for key metrics.

## 8. Error Handling and Resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling, retries, and fallback mechanisms for all storage interactions to ensure reliability.
### Details:
Use exponential backoff and jitter for retries, handle throttling and transient errors gracefully, and design for idempotency. Document error handling strategies for maintainability.

## 9. Cost Optimization and Resource Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2, 30.3, 30.4, 30.6, 30.7
### Description: Continuously optimize storage costs by tuning capacity, leveraging auto-scaling, and applying lifecycle policies.
### Details:
Enable DynamoDB auto-scaling, monitor and adjust GSI usage, use S3 storage classes and lifecycle rules, and right-size Redis clusters. Regularly review usage reports and adjust configurations for cost efficiency.
