# Task ID: 9
# Title: Interactive Project Portfolio with AI Insights
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build dynamic project showcase with AI-generated insights and interactive demonstrations
# Details:
Create interactive project cards with hover animations, category filtering, and search functionality. Implement detailed case studies with problem/solution format, technical stack visualization, and measurable outcomes. Add AI-generated project insights including technical highlights, business impact analysis, and learning outcomes. Include live demo integration, GitHub repository links, and interactive architecture diagrams using React Flow or similar.

# Test Strategy:
Test project card interactions, verify AI insight generation, validate search and filtering functionality, test responsive behavior, and ensure accessibility compliance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Project Card UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create visually appealing, accessible, and responsive card UI components for portfolio projects, following latest design best practices and ensuring support for varied content types and interactive states.
### Details:
Use modern UI libraries (e.g., React 19, Material UI v6, or Chakra UI v3). Ensure high contrast, legible typography, and clear separation from backgrounds. Implement hover, focus, and active states. Support media (images, video thumbnails) and call-to-action buttons. Ensure cards are responsive and adapt to all device sizes. Follow accessibility (WCAG 2.2) and security best practices for interactive elements.

## 2. Develop Filtering and Search Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement robust filtering and search features for portfolio projects, enabling users to quickly find relevant cards based on tags, technologies, or keywords.
### Details:
Utilize performant search libraries (e.g., Fuse.js v7) and implement debounced input handling. Ensure filters are accessible and keyboard-navigable. Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks. Optimize for large datasets with lazy loading or virtualized lists. Maintain state using Redux Toolkit v2 or React Context.

## 3. Create Case Study Detail Pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design and build dedicated pages for each project, showcasing in-depth case studies with rich media, structured content, and clear navigation.
### Details:
Use dynamic routing (e.g., Next.js App Router v14). Structure content with semantic HTML and ARIA roles. Support markdown or CMS-driven content for maintainability. Integrate responsive images and code snippets. Ensure SEO optimization and fast load times. Apply security headers and sanitize embedded content.

## 4. Implement Tech Stack Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Visualize each project's technology stack using interactive, accessible, and visually engaging components.
### Details:
Leverage charting libraries (e.g., Recharts v3, D3 v8) for stack diagrams. Use SVG for crisp rendering. Ensure color contrast and keyboard accessibility. Allow users to hover/click for tooltips or details. Keep data structures maintainable and extensible for future tech additions.

## 5. Integrate AI Insights and Recommendations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Embed AI-driven insights, such as project highlights, skill recommendations, or personalized suggestions, into the portfolio UI.
### Details:
Use secure API calls to AI services (e.g., OpenAI API v2, Azure AI). Cache results for performance. Display insights in a non-intrusive, context-aware manner (e.g., sidebars, tooltips). Ensure explainability and allow users to opt out. Sanitize and validate all AI-generated content before rendering.

## 6. Embed Live Demos Securely [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Allow users to interact with live demos of projects directly within the portfolio, ensuring security and performance.
### Details:
Use sandboxed iframes with strict CSP headers. Lazy-load demos to optimize performance. Provide fallback content for unsupported browsers. Monitor for XSS and clickjacking vulnerabilities. Clearly label demo environments and separate from production data.

## 7. Implement GitHub Linking and Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Add secure, context-aware GitHub links and badges to project cards and case study pages, enabling users to view source code and repository stats.
### Details:
Use GitHub API v4 (GraphQL) for dynamic repo data (stars, forks, last update). Validate and sanitize all external links. Open links in new tabs with rel="noopener noreferrer". Cache API responses to reduce rate limiting. Display badges and links with clear affordances.

## 8. Develop Interactive Diagrams and Visualizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Enable creation and embedding of interactive diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, architecture maps) within case study pages and project cards.
### Details:
Utilize libraries like Mermaid v10 or React Flow v12 for diagram rendering. Support zoom, pan, and node interaction. Ensure diagrams are accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation). Sanitize diagram definitions to prevent code injection. Allow easy updates and versioning for maintainability.
