# Task ID: 2
# Title: Mobile Navigation Emergency Fix (P0 Critical)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Repair broken mobile hamburger navigation menu affecting 70% of site traffic with modern 2025 accessibility, touch interaction, and performance standards
# Details:
CRITICAL UX ISSUE: Hamburger button renders but doesn't trigger navigation overlay on mobile devices. Debug mobile menu state management, check click/touch event handlers, verify CSS/JavaScript menu toggle logic, and test across iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile. Implement proper z-index and positioning, ensure touch interactions work smoothly, and support all screen sizes from 320px+. Use modern React state management with proper event handling. ENHANCED FOR 2025: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, modern ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation, focus management, optimized touch interactions with haptic feedback, smooth 60fps animations with GPU acceleration, and progressive enhancement strategies.

# Test Strategy:
Test hamburger menu functionality across all mobile devices and browsers, verify touch interactions (44x44px targets), menu overlay display/hide, navigation item selection, responsive behavior from 320px to tablet sizes, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader compatibility (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS), keyboard navigation, focus management, zoom support (200-400%), high contrast mode, and animation performance (60fps targets).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Event Handler Debugging for Mobile Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit and debug all JavaScript event handlers related to mobile navigation, ensuring correct binding, unbinding, and propagation for touch and click events. Use the latest debugging tools (e.g., React DevTools, Chrome DevTools) and implement secure remote debugging practices such as two-factor authentication and encrypted log collection. ENHANCED: Add comprehensive keyboard navigation support including ESC key handling, tab sequence management, focus trap implementation, and focus return to trigger button on close.
### Details:
Focus on touch and gesture events, prevent event leakage, and ensure handlers are not duplicated or left dangling. Implement ESC key listener for menu closure, establish proper tab sequence from logo to interactive elements, create focus trap when menu is active, ensure focus returns to hamburger button on menu close, and add visible focus states for keyboard users. Document findings and fixes for maintainability.

## 2. State Management Review and Refactoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Review the state management logic for mobile navigation, ensuring it uses the latest library versions (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or React Context API) and follows best practices for immutability, security, and maintainability. ENHANCED: Implement modern React Hook patterns, semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes, and performance optimizations.
### Details:
Refactor state logic to minimize side effects, prevent race conditions, and ensure predictable navigation state transitions. Replace any divs with proper button elements, implement aria-expanded, aria-controls, and role attributes. Ensure proper ARIA labeling that doesn't change on state toggle, add aria-hidden handling for icons with screen reader text. Use React Hook patterns for state management, Context API for navigation state if needed, React.memo for performance optimization, and efficient event handling patterns. Add unit tests for state changes.

## 3. CSS and Z-Index Layering Adjustments [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Audit and adjust CSS rules, focusing on z-index stacking, positioning, and responsive units to ensure the mobile navigation overlays and interacts correctly with all page elements. ENHANCED: Implement GPU-accelerated animations with 60fps targets and respect for user motion preferences.
### Details:
Use CSS custom properties and logical properties for maintainability. Test with the latest CSS features and ensure compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1). Implement requestAnimationFrame usage for smooth animations, GPU acceleration for transforms using transform3d and will-change properties, respect prefers-reduced-motion settings, optimize CSS transitions for performance targeting 60fps animations, and ensure smooth visual feedback for all interactions.

## 4. Cross-Browser and Device Mobile Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Test the mobile navigation across a comprehensive matrix of browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and devices (iOS, Android, tablets) using automated and manual testing tools.
### Details:
Leverage BrowserStack or Sauce Labs for device coverage. Document and fix browser-specific issues, ensuring consistent behavior and appearance.

## 5. Touch Interaction and Gesture Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Validate all touch interactions, including tap, swipe, and pinch gestures, ensuring they are intuitive, responsive, and accessible according to current best practices. ENHANCED: Implement 2025 touch standards with optimized target sizes, haptic feedback, and multi-touch error handling.
### Details:
Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px with adequate spacing (8px minimum). Implement visual feedback (color changes, animations) and haptic feedback where supported by device APIs. Test for accidental tap prevention and implement multi-touch error handling. Add touch gesture handling for swipe support, optimize touch response times, and ensure touch interactions work seamlessly across all supported devices and orientations.

## 6. Responsive Layout and Accessibility Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Verify that the mobile navigation adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes and orientations, maintaining usability and accessibility. ENHANCED: Implement comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader testing and zoom support.
### Details:
Test with dynamic viewport resizing, landscape/portrait modes, and screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS). Ensure high contrast mode support, readable text, and keyboard navigation support. Conduct WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing, validate color contrast ratios, test zoom functionality at 200-400% zoom levels, ensure proper heading hierarchy and landmark usage, and verify compatibility with assistive technologies.

## 7. Regression and Security Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct regression testing to ensure recent changes do not break existing features, and perform security audits on navigation-related code.
### Details:
Automate regression tests using Jest or Cypress. Check for vulnerabilities such as XSS in navigation links, and ensure secure handling of user input and navigation state.

## 8. Progressive Enhancement Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Implement progressive enhancement strategies to ensure navigation functionality works across all environments and gracefully degrades when JavaScript is unavailable.
### Details:
Create no-JS fallback navigation solutions using CSS-only menu implementations where possible. Ensure server-side rendering compatibility for initial page loads. Implement graceful degradation strategies that maintain core navigation functionality even when modern features are not supported. Test functionality with JavaScript disabled and ensure basic navigation remains accessible.
