# Task ID: 38
# Title: ML Model Showcase and Interactive Demonstrations System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 25, 26, 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive ML Model Showcase with ONNX Runtime Web integration for browser-based inference, SHAP/LIME explanations, WebAssembly SIMD optimization, and interactive feature engineering demonstrations.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive ML Model Showcase system using ONNX Runtime Web v1.18+ for browser-based machine learning inference with WebAssembly SIMD optimization for enhanced performance. Create interactive model demonstrations supporting computer vision (image classification, object detection), NLP (sentiment analysis, text classification), and tabular data models with real-time predictions. Integrate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for model explainability with interactive visualizations using D3.js and Plotly.js. Build interactive feature engineering playground allowing users to manipulate input features and observe real-time model predictions and explanations. Implement model comparison interface showcasing accuracy metrics, inference speed benchmarks, and memory usage statistics. Create edge deployment examples demonstrating model optimization techniques including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Add model upload functionality supporting ONNX, TensorFlow.js, and PyTorch models with automatic conversion pipelines. Implement WebWorker-based inference to prevent UI blocking, progressive model loading with caching strategies, and fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers. Include comprehensive model documentation with architecture diagrams, training data information, and performance characteristics. Integrate with existing design system using Tailwind CSS v4 glassmorphism components and ensure responsive design across all devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test ONNX Runtime Web integration across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers with WebAssembly SIMD support validation. Verify model inference accuracy by comparing browser predictions with server-side results using identical inputs. Test SHAP and LIME explanation generation for correctness and visual clarity across different model types. Validate interactive feature engineering with real-time prediction updates and explanation consistency. Test model upload functionality with various ONNX model formats and file sizes up to 100MB. Verify WebWorker implementation prevents UI blocking during inference operations. Test progressive loading and caching mechanisms with network throttling simulations. Validate responsive design and touch interactions on mobile devices. Test accessibility compliance for model explanations and interactive elements using screen readers. Verify performance benchmarks accuracy and memory usage monitoring across different devices and browsers.
