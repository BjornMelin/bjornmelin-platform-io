# Task ID: 32
# Title: Enterprise Security Headers and WAF Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive enterprise-grade security configuration including Content Security Policy headers, Web Application Firewall rules, DDoS protection, GDPR compliance mechanisms, and automated security scanning infrastructure.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive enterprise security infrastructure using AWS WAF v2 with CloudFront integration for DDoS protection and traffic filtering. Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers with strict-dynamic and nonce-based script execution, implement HTTP security headers including HSTS with preload, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy. Set up AWS WAF rules for SQL injection protection, XSS prevention, rate limiting (100 requests/5min per IP), geo-blocking for high-risk countries, and bot detection with CAPTCHA challenges. Implement GDPR compliance framework with cookie consent management, data processing audit logs, right-to-be-forgotten functionality, and privacy policy enforcement. Configure automated security scanning using AWS Inspector for vulnerability assessment, implement OWASP ZAP integration in CI/CD pipeline for dynamic security testing, and set up AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings. Create security monitoring with CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities, implement AWS GuardDuty for threat detection, and configure automated incident response workflows. Add security headers middleware for Next.js with helmet.js, implement rate limiting with Redis-based token bucket algorithm, and configure SSL/TLS security with perfect forward secrecy and OCSP stapling.

# Test Strategy:
Test WAF rules effectiveness by simulating SQL injection and XSS attacks using OWASP ZAP automated scans and manual penetration testing. Verify CSP headers prevent inline script execution and validate nonce generation for legitimate scripts. Test rate limiting by exceeding request thresholds and confirming proper 429 responses. Validate GDPR compliance by testing cookie consent flows, data export functionality, and deletion requests. Verify DDoS protection by load testing with Artillery.js and monitoring CloudFront metrics. Test security headers using Mozilla Observatory and SSL Labs for A+ ratings. Confirm automated security scanning integration in CI/CD pipeline and validate Security Hub findings aggregation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select, configure, and deploy a modern WAF solution (cloud-based or on-premises) to protect web applications from common threats such as SQL injection, XSS, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Ensure integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated rule updates and leverage advanced features like bot mitigation and API protection.
### Details:
Use the latest stable WAF solutions (e.g., AWS WAF, Cloudflare, or open-source alternatives). Enable logging, alerting, and automated rule tuning for maintainability and enterprise-grade reliability.

## 2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement strict CSP headers to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks. Test policies in report-only mode before enforcement and automate deployment via web server or application middleware.
### Details:
Utilize tools like CSP Evaluator and automate header management using libraries compatible with the latest frameworks (e.g., Helmet for Node.js, secure_headers for Ruby).

## 3. HTTP Security Headers Hardening [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and enforce essential HTTP security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) across all web applications and APIs.
### Details:
Automate header injection using up-to-date libraries and validate with security scanners. Ensure headers are included in all server responses and regularly reviewed for new recommendations.

## 4. DDoS Protection Enablement [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Implement multi-layered DDoS protection using cloud-based services and network-level controls. Configure rate-based rules, geo-blocking, and anomaly detection for real-time mitigation.
### Details:
Leverage advanced DDoS mitigation platforms (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield Advanced) and integrate with monitoring tools for automated response and alerting.

## 5. GDPR Compliance Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and update data handling processes, privacy policies, and consent mechanisms to ensure full GDPR compliance. Implement data minimization, encryption, and subject access request automation.
### Details:
Use compliance automation tools and maintain audit trails. Regularly review regulatory updates and conduct privacy impact assessments.

## 6. Automated Security Scanning Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate automated vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines for continuous assessment of code, dependencies, and infrastructure. Schedule regular scans and enforce remediation workflows.
### Details:
Adopt up-to-date scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP ZAP, Trivy) and ensure coverage for SAST, DAST, and dependency checks.

## 7. Security Monitoring and Threat Intelligence [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.4, 32.6
### Description: Deploy centralized security monitoring with SIEM integration and real-time alerting. Incorporate threat intelligence feeds for proactive detection and response.
### Details:
Utilize platforms like Splunk, SentinelOne, or open-source SIEMs. Automate correlation rules and ensure logs are retained per compliance requirements.

## 8. Incident Response Plan Development [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and document a comprehensive incident response plan, including detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review procedures.
### Details:
Conduct regular tabletop exercises, update contact lists, and automate incident ticketing and escalation workflows.

## 9. API and Application Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1, 32.4
### Description: Implement rate limiting and throttling controls at the API gateway and application layers to prevent abuse and mitigate brute-force attacks.
### Details:
Use up-to-date libraries (e.g., express-rate-limit for Node.js) and configure adaptive thresholds based on usage patterns. Monitor and alert on rate limit violations.

## 10. SSL/TLS Configuration and Certificate Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enforce HTTPS everywhere with strong SSL/TLS configurations, using the latest protocols and cipher suites. Automate certificate issuance, renewal, and revocation.
### Details:
Utilize tools like Let's Encrypt with ACME clients, regularly test configurations with SSL Labs, and enable HSTS preloading for maximum security.
