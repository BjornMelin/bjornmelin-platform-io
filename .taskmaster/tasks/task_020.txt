# Task ID: 20
# Title: Advanced Monitoring and Alerting System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring with real-time alerting and performance tracking
# Details:
Set up comprehensive monitoring with CloudWatch dashboards, real-time alerting for critical metrics, and performance tracking with custom metrics. Implement error tracking with Sentry, uptime monitoring, and business metrics correlation. Create automated incident response procedures, escalation policies, and post-mortem documentation workflows. Configure alerts for Core Web Vitals degradation, API errors, and security incidents.

# Test Strategy:
Test monitoring accuracy, verify alert triggers, validate incident response procedures, test dashboard functionality, and ensure comprehensive coverage of critical metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. CloudWatch Dashboard Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement CloudWatch dashboards for centralized monitoring of AWS resources, ensuring cross-account and cross-region visibility, and incorporating both standard and custom metrics.
### Details:
Follow AWS best practices for dashboard creation, including account-level and application-level dashboards, use of automatic and custom metrics, and cross-service visualization. Ensure dashboards are accessible to relevant teams and consider cost optimization for dashboard widgets and data retention. Use the latest CloudWatch dashboard features and maintain security by restricting dashboard access via IAM policies.[1][3][4]

## 2. Real-Time Alerting Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Set up real-time alerts using CloudWatch Alarms and SNS to notify stakeholders of critical events or threshold breaches.
### Details:
Define alarm thresholds for key metrics, configure multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, chat), and ensure alerts are actionable. Use composite alarms for advanced scenarios and test alert delivery. Secure SNS topics and alarm actions to prevent unauthorized access. Leverage the latest CloudWatch alarm features for reliability and low-latency alerting.[2][3]

## 3. Performance Metric Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive tracking of performance metrics across compute, storage, and application layers using CloudWatch and custom metrics.
### Details:
Identify and monitor key performance indicators (CPU, memory, latency, throughput, etc.) for all critical resources. Use the latest CloudWatch agent for enhanced metric collection and ensure metrics are tagged for easy filtering. Regularly review and update tracked metrics to align with evolving workloads. Secure metric data and follow least-privilege access principles.[3][5]

## 4. Error Monitoring and Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.3
### Description: Set up error monitoring by aggregating and visualizing log data for warnings, errors, and critical events in CloudWatch dashboards.
### Details:
Configure log streams and metric filters to count and categorize log events (e.g., WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). Visualize error trends on dashboards for rapid diagnosis. Use log insights queries for advanced analysis. Ensure log data is encrypted and access is restricted. Optimize log retention policies for cost and compliance.[4]

## 5. Automated Uptime and Health Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.3
### Description: Implement automated uptime and health checks using CloudWatch Synthetics or Lambda functions to monitor service availability.
### Details:
Configure canary scripts or Lambda-based health checks for critical endpoints. Integrate results into dashboards and alerting workflows. Use the latest AWS libraries and SDKs for scripting. Secure execution roles and limit permissions. Regularly update health check logic to reflect application changes.

## 6. Incident Response Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.5
### Description: Automate incident response workflows using AWS Systems Manager Automation, Lambda, or Step Functions triggered by CloudWatch alarms.
### Details:
Define automated remediation actions (e.g., restart services, scale resources) for common incidents. Ensure automation scripts are version-controlled, tested, and follow least-privilege principles. Log all automated actions for auditability. Use the latest AWS automation features and libraries.

## 7. Escalation Policy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.6
### Description: Establish and configure escalation policies for unresolved incidents, integrating with alerting and incident management tools.
### Details:
Define escalation tiers, notification channels, and response time objectives. Integrate with ticketing or on-call management systems. Ensure policies are documented, regularly reviewed, and tested. Secure escalation workflows to prevent unauthorized escalations.

## 8. Post-Mortem Workflow Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.6, 20.7
### Description: Develop and integrate post-mortem workflows for incident analysis, documentation, and continuous improvement.
### Details:
Automate collection of incident data, generate post-mortem templates, and facilitate collaborative reviews. Store post-mortems securely and ensure access for relevant stakeholders. Incorporate lessons learned into monitoring and automation improvements. Use the latest collaboration and documentation tools.
