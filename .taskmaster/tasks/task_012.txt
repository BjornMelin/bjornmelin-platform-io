# Task ID: 12
# Title: Technical Blog System with MDX Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build modern blog platform with MDX support and AI-assisted content enhancement
# Details:
Implement MDX-based blog system with code syntax highlighting using Prism.js, interactive examples with live code execution, and AI-assisted content optimization. Create blog post management with draft/published states, category organization, tag system, and reading time calculation. Add SEO optimization with structured data, social sharing integration, and comment system. Include AI suggestions for content improvement and technical accuracy validation.

# Test Strategy:
Test MDX rendering, verify code highlighting, validate SEO implementation, test content management features, and ensure AI assistance quality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. MDX Rendering Engine Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate and configure the latest MDX library (e.g., @mdx-js/react) for seamless rendering of Markdown with embedded React components, ensuring support for custom components, frontmatter parsing, and accessibility best practices.
### Details:
Set up MDX processing pipeline using Next.js 15 and TypeScript. Ensure support for custom components, frontmatter extraction, and accessibility compliance. Use Contentlayer or similar for content sourcing. Follow MDX best practices: use JSX only when necessary, leverage Markdown for structure, and ensure maintainability.

## 2. Code Syntax Highlighting Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement code syntax highlighting for code blocks within MDX posts using a modern, secure, and performant library (e.g., Shiki, PrismJS), supporting multiple languages and dark/light themes.
### Details:
Integrate code highlighting with MDX rendering. Use a library that supports SSR and theming. Ensure no XSS vulnerabilities by sanitizing code blocks. Optimize for performance and accessibility.

## 3. Live Code Execution Feature [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Enable live code execution for supported code blocks (e.g., JavaScript/React) within MDX posts, using a secure sandboxed environment (e.g., Sandpack, react-live), with error boundaries and user input controls.
### Details:
Integrate Sandpack or react-live for interactive code blocks. Ensure code execution is sandboxed to prevent security risks. Provide clear UI for code editing and output. Handle errors gracefully and support accessibility.

## 4. AI Content Optimization Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate AI-powered content optimization for blog posts, including grammar correction, readability analysis, and SEO suggestions, using the latest LLM APIs with privacy and security considerations.
### Details:
Set up server-side or build-time AI optimization using OpenAI or similar APIs. Ensure user data privacy, allow opt-in/opt-out, and provide actionable suggestions for authors. Log changes for auditability.

## 5. Post Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop a robust post management system for creating, editing, deleting, and organizing MDX posts, supporting frontmatter metadata (title, date, tags, categories, author) and version control integration.
### Details:
Implement CRUD operations for posts, with validation and preview. Store posts in a structured directory (e.g., /posts). Integrate with Git for versioning. Ensure role-based access control for editors/admins.

## 6. Category and Tag System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Implement a flexible category and tag system for organizing posts, supporting filtering, navigation, and dynamic page generation for each category/tag.
### Details:
Parse frontmatter metadata for categories and tags. Generate index pages for each. Enable filtering and navigation in the UI. Ensure SEO-friendly URLs and accessibility.

## 7. SEO Optimization and Metadata Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.6
### Description: Integrate advanced SEO features, including dynamic meta tags, Open Graph/Twitter cards, structured data, sitemap generation, and accessibility enhancements.
### Details:
Use Next.js Head API or next-seo for meta tags. Generate sitemaps and robots.txt. Add structured data (JSON-LD) for posts. Ensure all pages are crawlable and accessible. Validate with SEO tools.

## 8. Social Sharing Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add social sharing buttons for major platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit), supporting share counts, custom messages, and privacy-respecting implementations.
### Details:
Use libraries like react-share or custom components. Ensure buttons are accessible, performant, and do not leak user data. Allow customization of share text and images via frontmatter.

## 9. Comment System Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a secure, privacy-friendly comment system (e.g., Giscus, Commento, or custom solution) with moderation, spam protection, and accessibility support.
### Details:
Choose a comment system that supports GitHub/GitLab login or anonymous comments with moderation. Ensure GDPR compliance, spam filtering, and accessibility. Allow admins to moderate and export comments.
