# Task ID: 24
# Title: Server-Side Form Validation and Security Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive server-side form validation with rate limiting using Upstash Redis, input sanitization with DOMPurify, and security testing for XSS/CSRF protection.
# Details:
Implement robust server-side validation layer to complement client-side validation using Zod schemas for data validation and type safety. Set up Upstash Redis for distributed rate limiting with sliding window algorithm (10 requests per minute per IP, 100 requests per hour per user). Implement input sanitization using DOMPurify for HTML content and additional custom sanitizers for SQL injection prevention. Create CSRF protection using double-submit cookie pattern with secure, httpOnly tokens. Implement XSS protection with Content Security Policy headers, input encoding, and output escaping. Add request validation middleware for API routes, implement honeypot field validation server-side, and create comprehensive logging for security events. Use helmet.js for additional security headers, implement request size limits, and add IP-based blocking for suspicious activity. Create security audit endpoints for monitoring and alerting on potential threats.

# Test Strategy:
Test rate limiting with automated requests exceeding limits, verify CSRF token validation with invalid/missing tokens, test XSS prevention with malicious script injection attempts, validate input sanitization with SQL injection payloads, test honeypot field detection, verify security headers are properly set, test IP blocking functionality, validate request size limits, and perform comprehensive penetration testing for common vulnerabilities. Use security scanning tools like OWASP ZAP for automated vulnerability assessment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Zod Schema Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and enforce data schemas using Zod for all incoming server-side requests, ensuring type safety and runtime validation.
### Details:
Utilize the latest Zod version to create comprehensive schemas for each endpoint. Integrate with TypeScript using z.infer for type safety. Ensure all request payloads are validated before processing. Include custom validation logic for complex fields as needed. Follow best practices such as avoiding 'any', using .safeParse, and leveraging .transform for smart parsing.

## 2. Integrate Rate Limiting Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks by restricting the number of requests per user/IP.
### Details:
Use a modern, well-maintained rate limiting library (e.g., express-rate-limit or rate-limiter-flexible) compatible with your server framework. Configure limits based on endpoint sensitivity and expected traffic. Store rate limit data in a scalable backend (e.g., Redis) for distributed environments. Ensure error responses are clear and standardized.

## 3. Apply Input Sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Sanitize all incoming data to remove or neutralize potentially malicious content before further processing.
### Details:
Use libraries such as DOMPurify or validator.js for sanitizing strings, emails, and other user inputs. Integrate sanitization as a middleware step after schema validation. Ensure that all fields, including nested objects, are sanitized. Document sanitization rules for maintainability.

## 4. Implement CSRF Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Protect endpoints from Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks by validating CSRF tokens on state-changing requests.
### Details:
Use a robust CSRF protection library (e.g., csurf for Express). Ensure tokens are generated, stored, and validated securely. Apply CSRF protection to all POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE endpoints. Exclude safe endpoints (e.g., GET) as per best practices.

## 5. Enforce XSS Prevention Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Prevent Cross-Site Scripting by escaping output and sanitizing user-generated content.
### Details:
Ensure all user input displayed in responses is properly escaped. Use libraries like xss-clean or DOMPurify for output sanitization. Review templates and API responses for unsafe rendering. Educate developers on secure coding practices for XSS prevention.

## 6. Add Honeypot Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement honeypot fields to detect and block automated bot submissions.
### Details:
Add hidden form fields that should remain empty. Validate these fields server-side and reject requests where honeypots are filled. Log suspicious activity for further analysis. Ensure honeypot logic is unobtrusive to legitimate users.

## 7. Set Up Security Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5, 24.6
### Description: Log security-relevant events such as validation failures, rate limit breaches, and suspicious activity.
### Details:
Use a centralized logging solution (e.g., Winston, Bunyan, or a cloud-based SIEM). Ensure logs include timestamps, user identifiers, IP addresses, and event details. Mask sensitive data in logs. Set up alerts for critical security events.

## 8. Configure Security Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Use middleware such as helmet to set headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Strict-Transport-Security. Regularly review and update header configurations to align with current best practices.

## 9. Enforce Request Size Limits [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Limit the size of incoming requests to prevent resource exhaustion and buffer overflow attacks.
### Details:
Configure server and middleware (e.g., body-parser, express.json) to set maximum payload sizes for JSON, form, and file uploads. Return clear error messages for requests exceeding limits. Monitor and adjust limits based on usage patterns.

## 10. Conduct Security Audits and Reviews [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5, 24.6, 24.7, 24.8, 24.9
### Description: Regularly audit the codebase and dependencies for vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards.
### Details:
Use automated tools (e.g., Snyk, npm audit) and manual code reviews to identify and remediate security issues. Schedule periodic penetration testing. Document findings and remediation steps. Ensure all security controls are up-to-date and effective.
