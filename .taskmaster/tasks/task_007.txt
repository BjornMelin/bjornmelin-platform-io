# Task ID: 7
# Title: OpenAI GPT-4o Integration for AI-Enhanced Content
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate OpenAI GPT-4o for dynamic content generation and project insights
# Details:
Implement OpenAI API v5 integration with GPT-4o model for AI-generated project insights, content optimization suggestions, and automated skill assessments. Create content generation templates, implement caching for AI responses with Redis, build fallback mechanisms for API failures, and add intelligent lead scoring. Use structured prompts for consistent output quality and implement rate limiting to manage API costs.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI content generation quality, verify caching mechanisms, validate fallback scenarios, test rate limiting, and ensure content accuracy and relevance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Integration Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish secure, scalable integration with the chosen AI provider's API using the latest SDKs and libraries. Ensure compliance with enterprise security standards and regulatory requirements.
### Details:
Implement OAuth2 or API key authentication, enable TLS encryption, and configure endpoint whitelisting. Use field-level security and data masking where appropriate. Document all endpoints and integration flows.

## 2. Content Template Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Design and implement modular, reusable content templates for AI-generated outputs, supporting dynamic data insertion and localization.
### Details:
Use a templating engine compatible with your stack (e.g., Jinja2, Handlebars). Ensure templates are version-controlled, support A/B testing, and are easily maintainable. Validate templates for injection vulnerabilities.

## 3. Caching Layer Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Set up a robust caching mechanism to store and retrieve AI responses, reducing latency and API costs while maintaining data freshness and security.
### Details:
Leverage Redis or Memcached with appropriate TTLs. Implement cache key strategies that account for input parameters and user context. Encrypt sensitive cached data and monitor cache hit/miss rates.

## 4. Fallback Logic Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3
### Description: Develop resilient fallback mechanisms to handle API failures, timeouts, or degraded AI service, ensuring uninterrupted user experience.
### Details:
Implement circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff, and graceful degradation strategies. Provide static or cached responses when AI is unavailable. Log all fallback events for monitoring.

## 5. Lead Scoring Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Integrate AI-driven lead scoring logic, leveraging model outputs to prioritize and segment leads for downstream business processes.
### Details:
Define scoring criteria and thresholds. Store scores securely and expose them via internal APIs. Ensure explainability and auditability of scoring decisions for compliance.

## 6. Prompt Engineering Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop a prompt engineering framework to optimize AI model instructions for accuracy, consistency, and bias mitigation.
### Details:
Create a library of prompt templates, test variations, and implement prompt versioning. Automate prompt evaluation using metrics like relevance, coherence, and toxicity. Document best practices for prompt design.

## 7. Rate Limiting and Throttling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Implement advanced rate limiting and throttling to protect APIs from abuse, ensure fair usage, and comply with provider quotas.
### Details:
Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms. Monitor usage patterns, enforce per-user and per-IP limits, and provide informative error messages. Integrate with analytics for capacity planning.

## 8. Quality and Security Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of all AI integration components, focusing on functional correctness, security, performance, and compliance.
### Details:
Automate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Perform penetration testing, static code analysis, and compliance checks (GDPR, SOC 2). Continuously monitor for regressions and vulnerabilities.
