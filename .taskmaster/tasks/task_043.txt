# Task ID: 43
# Title: Enterprise-Grade Multi-Layer Caching Strategy with Next.js 15 App Router Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 27, 29, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive enterprise-grade caching architecture with CloudFront CDN optimization, Redis distributed caching, intelligent cache invalidation, and Next.js 15 ISR integration for optimal performance and cost reduction.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive multi-layer caching strategy leveraging Next.js 15 App Router with React 19 Server Components and advanced caching patterns. Configure CloudFront CDN with sophisticated caching policies including static asset optimization (CSS/JS/images with 1-year TTL), API response caching with custom cache keys, and dynamic content caching with edge-side includes. Set up Redis Cluster with ElastiCache for distributed caching implementing cache-aside and write-through patterns for database query optimization and session management. Integrate Next.js 15 ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) with revalidateTag() and revalidatePath() for intelligent cache invalidation, implement React 19 cache() API for request deduplication, and configure streaming SSR with selective hydration for optimal performance. Create automated cache warming strategies using CloudWatch Events and Lambda functions, implement cache analytics dashboard with real-time hit ratio monitoring using CloudWatch custom metrics, and configure browser caching headers with proper ETags and Last-Modified headers. Set up cache invalidation webhooks for content updates, implement cache versioning for deployment rollbacks, and configure Redis Sentinel for high availability. Integrate with DynamoDB caching layer for frequently accessed data, implement cache compression with Brotli/Gzip, and configure cache purging strategies for sensitive data. Create cache performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals correlation, implement cache warming for critical user paths, and set up automated cache optimization based on usage patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Test multi-layer caching effectiveness by measuring cache hit ratios across CloudFront (target >90%), Redis (target >85%), and Next.js ISR (target >95%) using CloudWatch metrics and custom analytics. Verify cache invalidation strategies by updating content and confirming propagation across all cache layers within 30 seconds. Test ISR functionality with revalidateTag() and revalidatePath() by triggering content updates and validating cache refresh. Validate Redis cluster performance under load using Redis benchmark tools and confirm failover scenarios with Sentinel. Test browser caching headers with various content types and verify ETags/Last-Modified headers are properly set. Measure Core Web Vitals improvements with caching enabled vs disabled, targeting LCP <1.8s, CLS <0.1, and INP <150ms. Test cache warming automation by deploying new versions and confirming critical paths are pre-cached. Validate cache analytics dashboard accuracy by comparing with actual request logs and CloudWatch metrics. Test cache compression effectiveness and measure bandwidth savings. Verify cache security by testing cache poisoning prevention and ensuring sensitive data is not cached inappropriately.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure CloudFront CDN and Browser Caching Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up AWS CloudFront with advanced caching policies for static assets (CSS, JS, images) using 1-year TTL, custom cache keys for API responses, and edge-side includes for dynamic content. Configure browser caching headers with ETags and Last-Modified for optimal client-side caching.
### Details:
Leverage CloudFront behaviors to differentiate between static and dynamic content. Implement cache versioning for deployment rollbacks and ensure Brotli/Gzip compression is enabled. Set up cache purging strategies for sensitive data and automate invalidation for content updates.

## 2. Implement Redis Cluster with ElastiCache for Distributed Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Deploy a Redis Cluster using AWS ElastiCache for distributed caching, supporting cache-aside and write-through patterns for database query optimization and session management. Integrate Redis Sentinel for high availability.
### Details:
Configure Redis to cache frequently accessed data and session tokens. Integrate with DynamoDB for hybrid caching. Ensure cache compression and secure access using enterprise security best practices.

## 3. Integrate Next.js 15 ISR and React 19 Server Component Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.2
### Description: Integrate Next.js 15 Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) using revalidateTag() and revalidatePath() for intelligent cache invalidation. Utilize React 19 cache() API for request deduplication and configure streaming SSR with selective hydration.
### Details:
Opt into caching for GET route handlers using static route config. Implement cache tags and cache life strategies for granular invalidation. Use experimental staleTimes for fine-tuned segment caching.

## 4. Automate Cache Warming, Invalidation, and Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.3
### Description: Develop automated cache warming strategies using CloudWatch Events and Lambda functions. Set up cache invalidation webhooks for content updates and implement real-time cache analytics dashboards with hit ratio monitoring using CloudWatch custom metrics.
### Details:
Automate cache warming for critical user paths and implement cache optimization routines based on usage patterns. Integrate cache analytics with Core Web Vitals for performance correlation.

## 5. Establish Enterprise-Grade Security and Testing for Caching Layers [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.4
### Description: Apply enterprise security patterns to all caching layers, including encryption in transit and at rest, secure cache key management, and access controls. Implement modern testing approaches for maintainability and low complexity.
### Details:
Enforce least privilege for cache access, audit cache operations, and ensure compliance with organizational security standards. Use TypeScript 5.8.4 for type safety and maintainable test suites.
