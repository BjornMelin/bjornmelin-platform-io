# Task ID: 16
# Title: Advanced Testing Suite Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing with 80%+ coverage using Vitest and Playwright
# Details:
Set up testing framework with Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E testing across browsers, and Storybook for component testing. Implement 80%+ test coverage with focus on critical user paths, form functionality, and AI integrations. Create visual regression testing with Chromatic, accessibility testing with axe-core, and performance testing with Lighthouse CI. Configure automated testing in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Achieve 80%+ test coverage, verify all critical user paths, test across multiple browsers and devices, validate accessibility compliance, and ensure CI/CD pipeline reliability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Vitest Setup and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure Vitest for unit and integration testing, ensuring compatibility with the latest Vite and project dependencies. Set up a dedicated vitest.config.ts for test-specific options, type safety, and maintainability.
### Details:
Follow best practices for configuration isolation, reference Vitest types, and ensure secure handling of environment variables. Integrate with React Testing Library if applicable, and document setup for maintainability.

## 2. Playwright E2E Test Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Install and configure Playwright for end-to-end browser testing, targeting critical user flows and edge cases. Ensure tests run reliably across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
### Details:
Leverage Playwright's advanced features such as test isolation, context reuse, and parallel execution. Store credentials securely and avoid hardcoding secrets. Document test structure for scalability.

## 3. Storybook Integration and Test Harness [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Integrate Storybook for component-driven development and visual documentation. Set up Storybook with the latest version and configure for seamless interaction with Vitest and Playwright.
### Details:
Enable Storybook's test runner and interaction testing. Ensure stories are isolated, reproducible, and follow accessibility and security best practices. Document usage for maintainability.

## 4. Coverage Enforcement and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Configure code coverage collection and enforcement using Vitest and Playwright. Set minimum thresholds for statements, branches, functions, and lines.
### Details:
Integrate coverage reports into CI/CD, generate HTML and lcov reports, and fail builds on insufficient coverage. Ensure sensitive data is excluded from reports.

## 5. Visual Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Implement visual regression testing using Playwright and Storybook. Capture baseline screenshots and automate comparison to detect UI changes.
### Details:
Configure threshold tolerances, manage baseline images securely, and automate review of diffs. Document process for updating baselines and handling false positives.

## 6. Accessibility (a11y) Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Integrate automated accessibility testing using tools like axe-core with Playwright and Storybook. Ensure all components and pages meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
### Details:
Automate a11y checks in CI, report violations, and document remediation steps. Include accessibility linting in development workflows.

## 7. Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Set up automated performance testing for key user journeys using Playwright and Lighthouse. Monitor metrics such as TTI, LCP, and CLS.
### Details:
Integrate performance budgets, automate regression detection, and report results in CI. Ensure tests are reproducible and avoid leaking sensitive data.

## 8. CI/CD Automation and Orchestration [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7
### Description: Automate the execution of all test suites (unit, E2E, visual, a11y, performance) in CI/CD pipelines. Enforce coverage, quality gates, and reporting.
### Details:
Use secure secrets management, parallelize jobs for speed, and ensure artifacts (reports, screenshots) are archived. Document pipeline configuration and troubleshooting steps.
