# Task ID: 40
# Title: NextAuth.js v5 Enterprise Authentication System with Multi-Tenant Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25, 28, 30, 31, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive NextAuth.js v5 enterprise authentication system with multi-tenant architecture, SSO integration, MFA, RBAC, and zero trust security patterns for enterprise deployment requirements.
# Details:
Implement NextAuth.js v5 enterprise authentication system with multi-tenant architecture support using the latest Auth.js framework. Configure multiple authentication providers including enterprise SSO with SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration for providers like Azure AD, Okta, and Google Workspace. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) with authenticator apps and SMS backup options. Create role-based access control (RBAC) system with hierarchical permissions including tenant-level isolation, user roles (admin, manager, user, viewer), and resource-based permissions. Configure JWT session management with 30-day expiry, secure httpOnly cookies, and automatic token refresh mechanisms. Implement zero trust security patterns including device fingerprinting, IP allowlisting, session anomaly detection, and continuous authentication validation. Set up tenant isolation with database-level separation, custom domain routing, and tenant-specific branding. Configure advanced session security with session fixation protection, concurrent session limits, and suspicious activity detection. Integrate with DynamoDB for user management and session storage, implement audit logging for compliance requirements, and create admin dashboard for tenant and user management. Use NextAuth.js v5's new configuration API with TypeScript support, implement custom providers for enterprise systems, and configure proper CSRF protection and secure session handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flows across all configured providers (SAML, OIDC, local) and verify successful login/logout processes. Validate MFA implementation by testing TOTP generation, SMS delivery, and backup code functionality. Test RBAC system by creating users with different roles and verifying access restrictions to protected resources. Validate JWT token generation, expiry, and refresh mechanisms using automated tests and manual verification. Test multi-tenant isolation by creating separate tenants and ensuring data segregation and custom domain routing. Verify zero trust security patterns by testing device fingerprinting accuracy, IP allowlisting enforcement, and session anomaly detection triggers. Test session security by attempting session fixation attacks, testing concurrent session limits, and validating suspicious activity detection. Perform penetration testing for authentication bypass attempts, CSRF attacks, and session hijacking scenarios. Test enterprise SSO integration with actual provider configurations and validate metadata exchange. Verify audit logging functionality and compliance reporting capabilities. Test admin dashboard functionality for tenant and user management operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up NextAuth.js v5 with Multi-Tenant Architecture in Next.js 15 [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a Next.js 15 project with TypeScript 5.8.4, install NextAuth.js v5, and configure the authentication system to support multi-tenant architecture, including tenant isolation via database-level separation, custom domain routing, and tenant-specific branding.
### Details:
Leverage the new NextAuth.js v5 configuration API for streamlined setup. Implement tenant-aware authentication flows and ensure each tenant's data and sessions are isolated. Use DynamoDB for scalable user and session storage.

## 2. Integrate Enterprise SSO Providers and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Configure enterprise SSO providers (SAML 2.0, OIDC for Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace) and implement MFA using TOTP with authenticator apps and SMS backup.
### Details:
Utilize NextAuth.js v5's provider system to add custom and built-in providers. Implement MFA flows post-SSO authentication, ensuring seamless user experience and secure fallback mechanisms.

## 3. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Hierarchical Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Design and implement an RBAC system supporting tenant-level isolation, user roles (admin, manager, user, viewer), and resource-based permissions.
### Details:
Store roles and permissions in DynamoDB, enforce access control in API routes and UI components, and provide utilities for permission checks. Ensure extensibility for future roles and granular permissions.

## 4. Enforce Zero Trust Security Patterns and Advanced Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2, 40.3
### Description: Implement zero trust security features including device fingerprinting, IP allowlisting, session anomaly detection, and continuous authentication validation. Configure JWT session management with 30-day expiry, httpOnly cookies, automatic token refresh, session fixation protection, concurrent session limits, and suspicious activity detection.
### Details:
Integrate device and IP checks into authentication flows. Monitor session behavior for anomalies and enforce session security best practices using NextAuth.js v5 and custom middleware.

## 5. Develop Admin Dashboard, Audit Logging, and Compliance Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.4
### Description: Create an admin dashboard for tenant and user management, implement audit logging for all authentication and authorization events, and ensure compliance with enterprise requirements.
### Details:
Build the dashboard using React 19 and TypeScript, integrating with backend APIs for user/tenant CRUD operations. Store audit logs in DynamoDB and expose secure endpoints for compliance reporting.
