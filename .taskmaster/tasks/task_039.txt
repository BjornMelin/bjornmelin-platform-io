# Title: Dual-Model AI Validation Architecture with OpenAI GPT-4o and Claude 4 Sonnet
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 30, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement enterprise-grade dual-model AI validation architecture using OpenAI GPT-4o for content generation and Claude 4 Sonnet for technical accuracy validation, with cross-validation pipeline, confidence scoring, and automated fact-checking.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive dual-model AI validation architecture using AI SDK v5 with provider registry pattern for seamless model switching and load balancing. Create primary content generation pipeline using OpenAI GPT-4o with structured prompts for project insights, technical recommendations, and skill assessments. Implement secondary validation layer using Claude 4 Sonnet for technical accuracy verification, reasoning validation, and fact-checking against documentation APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP docs). Build cross-validation pipeline with confidence scoring algorithm that compares outputs from both models, calculates consensus scores, and flags discrepancies for human review. Implement automated fact-checking system that validates technical claims against official documentation APIs using vector similarity search and semantic matching. Create enterprise security compliance layer with data encryption in transit/rest, audit logging, PII detection/redaction, and GDPR compliance mechanisms. Implement provider registry pattern with failover capabilities, circuit breaker pattern for API resilience, and intelligent routing based on query type and model strengths. Add comprehensive caching layer using Redis for validated responses, implement rate limiting per model provider, and create cost optimization strategies with request batching and response reuse. Build confidence scoring system using ensemble methods, semantic similarity analysis, and historical accuracy metrics to provide reliability scores for AI-generated content.

# Test Strategy:
Test dual-model integration by submitting identical prompts to both GPT-4o and Claude 4 Sonnet and verifying cross-validation pipeline correctly identifies consensus and discrepancies. Validate confidence scoring accuracy by comparing AI outputs against manually verified ground truth data and ensuring scores correlate with actual accuracy. Test automated fact-checking by submitting technical claims and verifying system correctly validates against documentation APIs with 95%+ accuracy. Verify enterprise security compliance by testing data encryption, audit logging functionality, and PII detection/redaction capabilities. Test provider registry failover by simulating API failures and ensuring seamless switching between models. Validate rate limiting and cost optimization by monitoring API usage patterns and verifying request batching effectiveness. Test caching layer performance and accuracy by measuring cache hit rates and validating cached response freshness. Conduct load testing with concurrent requests to verify system stability under enterprise workloads.
