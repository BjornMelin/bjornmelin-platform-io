# Task ID: 23
# Title: Client-Side Form Validation with React Hook Form and Zod
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive client-side form validation using React Hook Form v8 and Zod v4 schema validation for the contact form system with real-time validation feedback.
# Details:
Implement robust client-side form validation using React Hook Form v8 for form state management and Zod v4 for schema-based validation. Create comprehensive validation schemas for contact form fields including name (min 2 chars), email (RFC 5322 compliant), phone (international format), project type selection, budget range, timeline, and message (min 10 chars). Implement real-time validation with debounced input checking, custom error messages with internationalization support, and progressive enhancement for accessibility. Add advanced validation features including conditional field validation based on project type, file upload validation for attachments, and honeypot field detection for spam prevention. Configure form submission handling with optimistic UI updates, loading states, and comprehensive error boundary implementation. Integrate with existing ContactFormSchema and ensure seamless coordination with server-side validation. Implement field-level validation triggers, form-level validation on submit, and proper error state management with user-friendly error display patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Test all validation rules with valid and invalid inputs, verify real-time validation feedback timing and accuracy, test form submission with various data combinations, validate error message display and accessibility, test conditional validation logic, verify honeypot spam detection, test file upload validation limits, ensure proper form state management across user interactions, validate internationalization of error messages, and test form behavior with JavaScript disabled for progressive enhancement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Schema Design for Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a robust, maintainable validation schema using the latest stable version of a leading validation library (e.g., Zod, Yup, Joi). Ensure the schema supports extensibility, type safety, and enterprise-grade requirements.
### Details:
Research and select a validation library that aligns with project tech stack and supports advanced features. Design the schema to cover all form fields, including nested and conditional structures. Document the schema for maintainability.

## 2. Field-Level Validation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Implement field-level validation rules for all input types, ensuring coverage of required fields, data types, length, format, and custom business logic.
### Details:
Apply validation rules directly to each field using the schema. Ensure rules are up-to-date with current security and UX best practices. Include edge cases and locale-specific requirements.

## 3. Real-Time Feedback Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Enable real-time validation feedback as users interact with form fields, minimizing premature error display and supporting a seamless user experience.
### Details:
Configure validation to trigger on relevant events (e.g., onBlur, onChange) without overwhelming users. Use debouncing and only show errors after user interaction, following UX guidelines for timing and clarity.

## 4. Error Messaging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3
### Description: Design and implement an error messaging system that provides clear, human-readable, actionable, and non-blaming feedback, following the latest UX and accessibility standards.
### Details:
Craft error messages at a 5th-grade reading level, avoiding jargon. Ensure messages are visible, concise, and offer constructive advice. Use appropriate UI components (e.g., inline, toast, modal) based on error severity. Preserve user input and guide recovery.

## 5. Conditional Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Implement conditional validation rules that adapt based on user input and form state, supporting dynamic forms and complex business requirements.
### Details:
Use schema features or custom logic to enable/disable or alter validation rules based on other field values. Ensure maintainability and test coverage for all conditional paths.

## 6. File Upload Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Add client-side validation for file uploads, covering file type, size, count, and security (e.g., MIME type spoofing prevention).
### Details:
Leverage the validation schema and browser APIs to enforce file constraints before upload. Provide immediate, clear feedback for invalid files and prevent submission of unsafe or unsupported files.

## 7. Honeypot Field Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Integrate a hidden honeypot field to detect and block automated bot submissions, enhancing security with minimal user impact.
### Details:
Add a non-visible field to the form and validate that it remains empty on the client side. Ensure the field is inaccessible to assistive technologies and does not affect accessibility.

## 8. Accessibility and Usability Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4, 23.6, 23.7
### Description: Conduct comprehensive accessibility and usability testing of all validation features, ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.2 and ARIA standards.
### Details:
Test error messaging, real-time feedback, and field focus management with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Validate color contrast, ARIA attributes, and error associations. Document and resolve any accessibility issues.
