# Task ID: 18
# Title: Real-Time Features with Server-Sent Events
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time analytics and live updates using Server-Sent Events
# Details:
Implement Server-Sent Events for real-time analytics updates, live visitor count display, and dynamic content updates. Create event streams for analytics data, opportunity notifications, and system status updates. Use EventSource API for client-side connection management, implement reconnection logic for reliability, and add proper error handling. Configure Redis for real-time data caching and event distribution.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time data updates, verify connection reliability, validate reconnection logic, test across different browsers, and ensure proper error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up SSE Backend Endpoint with Proper Headers and Security [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a backend endpoint for Server-Sent Events (SSE) using the latest stable version of your backend framework (e.g., Express 5.x). Ensure correct SSE headers (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`), and implement security best practices such as CORS configuration, authentication, and rate limiting.
### Details:
Follow best practices for SSE header setup and security. Use middleware for authentication and CORS. Reference latest library documentation for updates.

## 2. Integrate Client-Side EventSource with Advanced Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Implement the client-side integration using the EventSource API, ensuring compatibility with the latest browser versions. Add support for custom event types, message parsing, and efficient DOM updates. Document usage patterns for React and vanilla JS clients.
### Details:
Leverage the EventSource API as per MDN and recent guides. Ensure typed event handling and efficient state management in the client.

## 3. Implement Analytics Event Streaming and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Design and implement a mechanism to stream analytics events from the backend to the client in real time. Ensure events are structured, typed, and logged for monitoring and debugging. Integrate with existing analytics platforms if required.
### Details:
Use structured event names and payloads. Ensure compliance with privacy and data retention policies.

## 4. Develop Robust Reconnection and Error Handling Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Implement reconnection logic on the client using EventSource's built-in features and custom logic for exponential backoff. Handle server disconnects, network errors, and provide user feedback. Ensure the backend gracefully handles client disconnects and cleans up resources.
### Details:
Follow best practices for error handling and reconnection as outlined in recent SSE guides. Ensure resource cleanup on both client and server.

## 5. Integrate Redis Caching for Scalable Event Delivery [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.3
### Description: Set up Redis as a caching layer to buffer and broadcast events to multiple clients efficiently. Ensure cache invalidation, data consistency, and secure Redis configuration. Use the latest Redis client libraries and follow enterprise security guidelines.
### Details:
Implement Redis pub/sub or streams for event distribution. Secure Redis with authentication and network restrictions.

## 6. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4, 18.5
### Description: Add centralized error handling on both backend and client. Integrate monitoring tools to track connection health, event delivery, and error rates. Set up alerts for critical failures and log all relevant events for auditability.
### Details:
Use observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Sentry) and structured logging. Ensure compliance with enterprise monitoring standards.

## 7. Conduct Cross-Browser Testing and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.4, 18.6
### Description: Test the SSE implementation across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices. Identify and address compatibility issues, optimize for low-latency delivery, and document any browser-specific workarounds.
### Details:
Use automated testing tools and manual QA. Document findings and update implementation for maximum compatibility and performance.
