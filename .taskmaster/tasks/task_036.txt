# Task ID: 36
# Title: Accessibility Validation and Content Review with WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 34, 5, 15, 19, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive accessibility validation and content review to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader testing and content optimization for launch readiness.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive accessibility validation infrastructure using axe-core v4.8+ for automated WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing, Pa11y for command-line accessibility testing, and Lighthouse accessibility audits integrated into CI/CD pipeline. Configure screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver across Windows, macOS, and mobile platforms to validate navigation patterns, form interactions, and content comprehension. Implement accessibility testing in Playwright E2E tests using @axe-core/playwright for automated regression testing. Conduct manual accessibility review including keyboard navigation testing (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys), focus management validation, color contrast verification using WebAIM Contrast Checker, and semantic HTML structure analysis. Review all content for plain language compliance, reading level optimization (target 8th grade level), alternative text for images, video captions, and audio transcripts. Implement accessibility-first design patterns including proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6), ARIA labels and landmarks, skip navigation links, and focus indicators. Create accessibility testing checklist covering perceivable (text alternatives, captions, color contrast), operable (keyboard accessible, no seizures, navigable), understandable (readable, predictable), and robust (compatible with assistive technologies) principles. Configure automated accessibility monitoring with continuous scanning and reporting dashboards.

# Test Strategy:
Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance by running automated axe-core scans achieving zero violations and Pa11y tests passing all checkpoints. Test screen reader functionality by navigating entire site using NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver, confirming logical reading order, proper announcements, and form field identification. Validate keyboard navigation by completing all user flows using only keyboard input, ensuring focus visibility and logical tab order. Test color contrast ratios using automated tools and manual verification, confirming 4.5:1 ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Verify content readability using Flesch-Kincaid grade level analysis targeting 8th grade comprehension. Test responsive accessibility across mobile devices and screen readers, validating touch target sizes (minimum 44px) and gesture alternatives. Conduct user testing with individuals using assistive technologies to validate real-world accessibility experience and gather feedback for improvements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Automated WCAG Compliance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate and configure the latest automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe-core, Pa11y, Lighthouse) into the CI/CD pipeline to scan for WCAG 2.2/3.0 violations across all pages and components.
### Details:
Ensure tools are updated to their latest stable versions, configure for enterprise-grade reporting, and set up fail criteria for critical issues. Document tool configurations for maintainability and security.

## 2. Screen Reader Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Conduct manual and automated screen reader tests using popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to verify content is navigable and understandable.
### Details:
Test across major browsers and operating systems. Document findings and remediation steps. Ensure ARIA roles and landmarks are correctly announced.

## 3. Keyboard Navigation Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Verify that all interactive elements are accessible and operable via keyboard alone, ensuring logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
### Details:
Test for keyboard traps, skip links, and ensure all modals/dialogs are accessible. Use automated tools and manual walkthroughs.

## 4. Color Contrast and Visual Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Automate color contrast analysis using tools like axe or Color Contrast Analyzer and manually review for visual clarity and non-color cues.
### Details:
Ensure all text and interactive elements meet or exceed WCAG AA/AAA contrast ratios. Document exceptions and remediation plans.

## 5. Content Readability Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Assess content for plain language, reading level, and clarity using automated readability tools and manual editorial review.
### Details:
Check for jargon, complex sentences, and provide alternative formats where necessary. Ensure instructions and error messages are clear.

## 6. Alt Text and Caption Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Automate detection of missing or inadequate alt text for images and captions for multimedia, followed by manual review for context and accuracy.
### Details:
Ensure all non-text content has meaningful descriptions. Use latest best practices for alt text and captioning, including for dynamic and decorative images.

## 7. ARIA and Semantic Markup Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Review and validate the use of ARIA attributes and semantic HTML to ensure proper structure and assistive technology compatibility.
### Details:
Automate checks for ARIA misuse and missing landmarks, then manually inspect complex widgets. Document and remediate violations.

## 8. Accessibility Checklist Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1, 36.2, 36.3, 36.4, 36.5, 36.6, 36.7
### Description: Develop and maintain a comprehensive accessibility checklist tailored to the project, incorporating WCAG, legal, and organizational requirements.
### Details:
Checklist should be version-controlled, regularly updated, and integrated into QA processes. Include references to best practices and security considerations.

## 9. User Testing with Assistive Technology Users [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Recruit and conduct usability sessions with users who have diverse disabilities to validate real-world accessibility and uncover edge cases.
### Details:
Gather actionable feedback, prioritize issues based on user impact, and iterate on solutions. Ensure privacy and security of participant data.

## 10. Accessibility Monitoring and Regression Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1, 36.8, 36.9
### Description: Implement ongoing automated monitoring for accessibility regressions using cloud-based tools and dashboards, with alerting for new issues.
### Details:
Schedule regular scans, integrate with issue tracking, and ensure maintainability. Review monitoring results in sprint retrospectives.
