# Task ID: 29
# Title: CloudFront CDN and Route 53 DNS Configuration with SSL/TLS and Global Content Delivery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure AWS CloudFront CDN distribution with Route 53 DNS management, SSL/TLS certificates via ACM, custom domain setup, and optimized caching policies for global content delivery performance.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive AWS CloudFront CDN infrastructure using AWS CDK v2 for global content delivery optimization. Create CloudFront distribution with multiple origins including S3 bucket for static assets and ALB for dynamic content, configure custom domain with Route 53 hosted zone and CNAME records pointing to CloudFront distribution. Request and validate SSL/TLS certificates through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) with automatic DNS validation via Route 53. Implement sophisticated caching policies including separate behaviors for static assets (CSS/JS/images with 1-year TTL), API responses (no-cache with proper headers), and HTML content (short TTL with ETag validation). Configure origin request policies to forward necessary headers, query strings, and cookies while optimizing cache hit ratios. Set up CloudFront Functions for URL rewrites, security headers injection (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), and request/response manipulation. Implement geographic restrictions if needed, configure custom error pages with S3 fallback, and set up real-time logs for monitoring. Create multiple cache behaviors for different content types: static assets with aggressive caching, API endpoints with no-cache policies, and dynamic content with appropriate TTL values. Configure compression (Gzip/Brotli) for text-based content, implement HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support, and set up origin failover for high availability. Use CloudFront security features including AWS WAF integration, origin access control (OAC) for S3 bucket security, and signed URLs/cookies for protected content access.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CloudFront distribution deployment and global edge location propagation using dig commands and online DNS propagation checkers. Test SSL certificate validation across multiple browsers and SSL testing tools like SSL Labs. Validate caching behavior by checking response headers (Cache-Control, ETag, Last-Modified) for different content types and verifying cache hit/miss ratios in CloudFront metrics. Test custom domain resolution from multiple geographic locations using tools like whatsmydns.net and verify HTTPS redirects work correctly. Perform load testing to validate origin failover functionality and measure performance improvements with tools like GTmetrix, PageSpeed Insights, and WebPageTest from different global locations. Test CloudFront Functions execution by verifying security headers injection and URL rewrite functionality. Validate geographic restrictions if implemented and test custom error page delivery. Monitor CloudWatch metrics for cache hit ratio (target >85%), origin latency, and error rates to ensure optimal performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Provision and Configure CloudFront Distribution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Amazon CloudFront distribution with smart defaults, ensuring the latest features and automation are enabled for streamlined CDN setup.
### Details:
Use the latest CloudFront interface to create a distribution, selecting the appropriate delivery method (web or RTMP), and enable automation features for DNS and TLS provisioning where available. Ensure logging and monitoring are enabled for maintainability and compliance.

## 2. Configure Origin Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Define and secure the origin(s) for the CloudFront distribution, including S3 buckets, custom HTTP servers, or load balancers.
### Details:
Specify origin domain names, set up origin access control (OAC) or origin access identity (OAI) for S3, and enforce HTTPS-only communication between CloudFront and the origin. Apply security headers and restrict allowed HTTP methods for best practices.

## 3. Set Up Route 53 DNS Records [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Configure Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution using ALIAS or CNAME records as appropriate.
### Details:
For apex domains, create ALIAS records pointing to the CloudFront distribution. For subdomains, use CNAME records. Ensure TTL values are optimized for propagation and failover. Validate DNS propagation using tools like dig or nslookup.

## 4. Request and Attach SSL/TLS Certificates [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.3
### Description: Provision public SSL/TLS certificates via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and associate them with the CloudFront distribution for secure HTTPS delivery.
### Details:
Request certificates for all relevant domains (including wildcards if needed), complete DNS validation, and attach the certificates to the CloudFront distribution. Enforce TLS 1.2+ and strong cipher suites for enterprise-grade security.

## 5. Define and Apply Caching Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2
### Description: Configure CloudFront caching behaviors to optimize performance and cost, leveraging the latest cache policy features.
### Details:
Set up cache policies for path patterns, customize TTLs, and control cache key settings (headers, cookies, query strings). Use managed policies where possible for maintainability, and fine-tune for dynamic/static content as needed.

## 6. Implement CloudFront Functions and Edge Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.5
### Description: Deploy CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge for lightweight request/response manipulation at the edge.
### Details:
Write and attach functions for URL rewrites, header manipulation, authentication, or custom error handling. Ensure code is optimized for low latency and adheres to security best practices.

## 7. Configure Custom Error Pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.5
### Description: Set up custom error responses in CloudFront to improve user experience and provide branded error messaging.
### Details:
Define custom error pages for common HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500), configure response codes, and set TTLs for error caching. Ensure error pages are accessible and do not leak sensitive information.

## 8. Enable Compression and Content Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.5
### Description: Activate Gzip and Brotli compression in CloudFront to reduce payload size and improve load times.
### Details:
Enable automatic compression for supported file types, verify content encoding headers, and test delivery to ensure compatibility with client browsers. Monitor for any issues with compressed asset delivery.

## 9. Integrate Security Features and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2, 29.4
### Description: Apply advanced security controls and monitoring to the CloudFront distribution for enterprise-grade protection.
### Details:
Integrate AWS WAF for web application firewall protection, enable Shield Standard for DDoS mitigation, enforce geo-restrictions, and set up real-time logging and alarms. Regularly review access logs and security metrics for anomalies.
