# Task ID: 8
# Title: Advanced Analytics and Monitoring System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27, 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive analytics with real-time visitor tracking and performance monitoring
# Details:
Integrate Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights with custom DynamoDB analytics storage. Implement real-time visitor behavior tracking, Core Web Vitals monitoring, conversion funnel analysis, and GDPR-compliant data collection. Create analytics dashboard with engagement metrics, performance insights, and business intelligence. Use VisitorAnalyticsSchema for data validation and implement automated reporting.

# Test Strategy:
Test analytics data collection, verify GDPR compliance, validate real-time tracking accuracy, test dashboard functionality, and ensure data privacy and security.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Vercel Analytics with Application [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Vercel Analytics using the latest @vercel/analytics package, configure the Analytics component in the app's root layout, and ensure deployment to Vercel's Edge Network.
### Details:
Follow Vercel's official documentation for installation and configuration. Confirm analytics data is visible in the Vercel dashboard and that custom events can be tracked.

## 2. Implement Custom DynamoDB Storage for Analytics Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Design and implement a DynamoDB schema to store custom analytics events, ensuring scalability, low latency, and cost-effectiveness.
### Details:
Use AWS SDK v3 and follow DynamoDB best practices (partition keys, indexes, TTL). Ensure data is anonymized and compliant with privacy standards.

## 3. Enable Real-Time Analytics Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop a real-time event ingestion pipeline from the application to DynamoDB, leveraging serverless functions or streaming (e.g., AWS Lambda, Kinesis).
### Details:
Implement event batching and error handling. Ensure minimal impact on application performance and data consistency.

## 4. Monitor and Collect Core Web Vitals [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Integrate Core Web Vitals monitoring using the latest web-vitals library and send metrics to both Vercel Analytics and custom DynamoDB storage.
### Details:
Track LCP, FID, CLS, INP, and TTFB. Store metrics with timestamps and user/session identifiers (hashed/anonymized).

## 5. Implement Funnel Analysis Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Define key user journeys and conversion funnels, and implement logic to track funnel steps and drop-offs using custom events.
### Details:
Store funnel progression data in DynamoDB. Ensure funnel definitions are configurable and support A/B testing scenarios.

## 6. Ensure GDPR and Privacy Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.4
### Description: Audit analytics data collection, storage, and processing for GDPR compliance. Implement consent management and data subject rights handling.
### Details:
Document data flows, anonymize PII, and provide mechanisms for data deletion/export. Leverage Vercel's privacy features and supplement as needed.

## 7. Develop Analytics Dashboard UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Design and implement a responsive dashboard UI for visualizing analytics data, including real-time metrics, Core Web Vitals, and funnel analysis.
### Details:
Use a modern frontend framework (e.g., Next.js, React) and charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts). Ensure accessibility and role-based access control.

## 8. Implement Data Validation and Quality Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Develop validation logic for incoming analytics events and stored data to ensure accuracy, completeness, and schema consistency.
### Details:
Use schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod, Joi) and set up automated tests for data integrity. Monitor for anomalies and missing data.

## 9. Set Up Automated Analytics Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.7, 8.8
### Description: Create scheduled reports (e.g., daily, weekly) summarizing key metrics, trends, and anomalies, delivered via email or dashboard notifications.
### Details:
Automate report generation using serverless functions or scheduled jobs. Support export to CSV/PDF and integration with BI tools if needed.

## 10. Conduct Security and Privacy Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.6, 8.7, 8.8
### Description: Perform comprehensive security and privacy testing of the analytics stack, including penetration testing, data access audits, and privacy impact assessments.
### Details:
Test for vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, XSS), enforce least-privilege access, and validate compliance with enterprise security standards.
