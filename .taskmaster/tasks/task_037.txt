# Task ID: 37
# Title: Final Load Testing and Production Deployment Procedures with Blue-Green Deployment Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33, 35, 36, 32, 29, 31, 30, 27, 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive final load testing and establish production deployment procedures with blue-green deployment validation, rollback testing, and complete production readiness verification.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive final load testing infrastructure using Artillery.io or k6 for performance testing with realistic user scenarios including 1000+ concurrent users, 10,000+ requests per minute, and sustained load testing over 30+ minutes. Configure load testing scenarios for critical user paths including contact form submissions, page navigation, API endpoints, and real-time features with Server-Sent Events. Establish blue-green deployment procedures using AWS CodeDeploy with Application Load Balancer target group switching, implementing automated health checks, smoke tests, and canary deployments with 10% traffic routing for validation. Create comprehensive rollback procedures with automated triggers based on error rates >1%, response times >3s, or failed health checks, including database migration rollbacks and CDN cache invalidation. Implement production readiness verification checklist including SSL certificate validation, DNS propagation testing, WAF rule verification, monitoring dashboard functionality, backup system validation, and disaster recovery procedures. Configure automated deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions triggering blue-green deployments, including pre-deployment security scans, post-deployment smoke tests, and automated rollback on failure. Set up comprehensive production monitoring with CloudWatch alarms for deployment success/failure, application performance metrics, and business KPIs. Create deployment documentation with runbooks, incident response procedures, and post-deployment verification steps.

# Test Strategy:
Verify load testing infrastructure by executing performance tests with 1000+ concurrent users and validating response times remain under 2s for 95th percentile. Test blue-green deployment process by deploying test applications and confirming zero-downtime switching between environments using ALB target group health checks. Validate rollback procedures by intentionally introducing failures and confirming automatic rollback triggers within 60 seconds. Test production readiness verification by running complete checklist and confirming all systems pass validation including SSL Labs A+ rating, DNS propagation across global resolvers, WAF protection against OWASP Top 10, and monitoring dashboard real-time data display. Verify deployment pipeline automation by pushing code changes and monitoring complete deployment cycle including security scans, blue-green switching, smoke tests, and rollback capabilities. Test disaster recovery procedures by simulating various failure scenarios and confirming recovery time objectives (RTO) under 15 minutes and recovery point objectives (RPO) under 5 minutes.

# Subtasks:

## 2. Scenario Scripting for Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive load test scripts covering peak, sustained, and edge-case scenarios using up-to-date scripting libraries and frameworks.
### Details:
Include authentication flows, API endpoints, and simulate real user behavior. Parameterize scripts for maintainability and reuse.

## 3. Blue-Green Deployment Pipeline Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.2
### Description: Set up automated blue-green deployment pipelines using CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) and cloud-native load balancers.
### Details:
Leverage infrastructure-as-code for environment parity, automate traffic switching, and integrate with monitoring for real-time validation.

## 4. Automated Health Checks Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3
### Description: Implement robust health checks (liveness, readiness, and custom probes) in deployment pipelines to validate application and infrastructure health post-deployment.
### Details:
Use cloud-native health check endpoints and integrate with orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes). Ensure checks are comprehensive and fail-fast.

## 5. Canary Deployment and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.4
### Description: Configure canary deployment strategy to route a small percentage of traffic to the new release, monitor key metrics, and automate progressive rollout.
### Details:
Utilize cloud observability tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor) for real-time validation and rollback triggers.

## 6. Automated Rollback Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.5
### Description: Develop and test automated rollback mechanisms for both blue-green and canary deployments, ensuring rapid recovery from failures.
### Details:
Integrate rollback logic into CI/CD pipelines, maintain versioned artifacts, and document rollback triggers and escalation paths.

## 7. Production Readiness Checklist Finalization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compile and validate a comprehensive readiness checklist covering security, performance, compliance, and operational requirements.
### Details:
Checklist should include verification of monitoring, alerting, backup, access controls, and documentation completeness.

## 8. SSL Certificate and DNS Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify SSL/TLS certificate validity, renewal automation, and DNS configuration for all endpoints, ensuring secure and reliable connectivity.
### Details:
Automate certificate checks, enforce strong cipher suites, and validate DNS propagation and failover settings.

## 9. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test and validate WAF rules and policies for the new deployment, ensuring protection against OWASP Top 10 and emerging threats.
### Details:
Use latest WAF solutions (e.g., AWS WAF, Azure WAF), simulate attack scenarios, and review logs for false positives/negatives.

## 10. Monitoring and Alerting Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement advanced monitoring and alerting for application, infrastructure, and security events using cloud-native and third-party tools.
### Details:
Configure dashboards, anomaly detection, and automated incident response integrations. Ensure coverage for all critical components.

## 11. Disaster Recovery Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct disaster recovery drills to validate backup, restore, and failover procedures, ensuring minimal RTO/RPO and compliance with enterprise standards.
### Details:
Automate recovery scenarios, document outcomes, and address gaps in recovery plans.

## 12. Deployment Documentation and Knowledge Transfer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Produce detailed, up-to-date deployment documentation covering architecture, procedures, troubleshooting, and rollback steps. Facilitate knowledge transfer sessions.
### Details:
Ensure documentation is version-controlled, accessible, and reviewed for accuracy and completeness.
