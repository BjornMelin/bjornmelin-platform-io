# Task ID: 45
# Title: Real-time Collaboration and Interactive Features System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 30, 31, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive real-time collaboration platform with WebSocket integration, live chat, document collaboration, whiteboarding, code review demonstrations, and interactive portfolio features.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive real-time collaboration infrastructure using WebSocket connections with Socket.IO for bidirectional communication and Server-Sent Events for one-way data streams. Create WebSocket server with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling and session management across multiple instances. Implement live chat system with message persistence in DynamoDB, typing indicators, user presence status, and message history with pagination. Build real-time document collaboration using Operational Transformation (OT) algorithms with ShareJS or Yjs for conflict resolution, enabling simultaneous editing with live cursors and user annotations. Create shared whiteboarding capabilities using HTML5 Canvas with real-time synchronization, drawing tools, shape recognition, and collaborative annotations. Implement live code review demonstrations with syntax highlighting using Prism.js, real-time code execution preview, and collaborative commenting system. Build presence indicators showing active users, their current location within documents, and activity status with automatic idle detection. Create real-time notification system for portfolio reviews, project discussions, and collaboration invites with push notifications using Web Push API. Implement live session replay functionality with event recording and playback capabilities for portfolio demonstrations. Integrate calendar scheduling with Google Calendar API and Calendly webhooks for automated session booking. Add video conferencing integration with Zoom SDK or WebRTC for screen sharing and video calls. Implement automated session recording with AWS MediaLive for client consultations and portfolio presentations. Create collaborative planning sessions with real-time Kanban boards, task assignment, and progress tracking. Use Redis for real-time data caching, session storage, and pub/sub messaging between WebSocket instances. Implement rate limiting for WebSocket connections and message frequency to prevent abuse. Add comprehensive error handling, connection recovery, and offline mode support with message queuing.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebSocket connection establishment and reconnection logic across different network conditions and browser environments. Verify real-time message delivery and ordering in chat system with multiple concurrent users. Test document collaboration with simultaneous editing scenarios, conflict resolution, and operational transformation accuracy. Validate whiteboard synchronization with complex drawing operations and multiple users. Test presence indicators accuracy and real-time updates when users join/leave sessions. Verify live code review functionality with syntax highlighting and collaborative commenting. Test session recording and playback with various content types and durations. Validate calendar integration with booking creation, updates, and cancellations. Test video conferencing integration with screen sharing and audio/video quality. Verify notification delivery across different devices and browsers. Test rate limiting effectiveness and error handling for connection failures. Validate offline mode functionality and message queue processing when connection is restored. Perform load testing with multiple concurrent users and high message frequency. Test cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness for all collaboration features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Establish Real-Time Communication Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a scalable WebSocket server using Socket.IO with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling, session management, and enterprise-grade security. Integrate Server-Sent Events for one-way data streams and implement rate limiting, error handling, and offline mode support.
### Details:
Utilize Next.js 15 API routes for WebSocket endpoints, configure Redis for pub/sub and session storage, and enforce security best practices such as JWT authentication, CSRF protection, and encrypted communication. Ensure maintainability with modular TypeScript 5.8.4 code and comprehensive logging.

## 2. Implement Real-Time Collaborative Document and Whiteboard Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Develop collaborative document editing using Operational Transformation (OT) algorithms with ShareJS or Yjs, and build a synchronized whiteboard using HTML5 Canvas with real-time drawing, shape recognition, and annotation capabilities.
### Details:
Integrate live cursors, user annotations, and conflict resolution for documents. For whiteboarding, synchronize canvas state across clients using WebSocket events, and provide drawing tools with React 19 components. Ensure all collaboration actions are auditable and recoverable.

## 3. Develop Live Chat, Presence, and Notification Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Create a live chat system with message persistence in DynamoDB, typing indicators, user presence tracking, and message history with pagination. Implement real-time notifications for collaboration events using the Web Push API.
### Details:
Design chat UI with React 19, manage chat state with Redux Toolkit, and ensure secure message storage. Implement presence indicators showing user activity and location within documents. Use push notifications for portfolio reviews and invites.

## 4. Integrate Code Review, Video Conferencing, and Session Recording [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Build live code review demonstrations with syntax highlighting (Prism.js), real-time code execution preview, and collaborative commenting. Integrate video conferencing (Zoom SDK or WebRTC) with screen sharing and automated session recording using AWS MediaLive.
### Details:
Enable real-time code collaboration with commenting and execution preview. Provide seamless video call and screen sharing experience, and automate recording and storage of sessions for portfolio demonstrations.

## 5. Implement Collaborative Planning, Scheduling, and Portfolio Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1, 45.2, 45.3, 45.4
### Description: Create real-time Kanban boards for collaborative planning, integrate calendar scheduling with Google Calendar API and Calendly webhooks, and build interactive portfolio features with live session replay and event playback.
### Details:
Design Kanban and scheduling UIs with React 19, synchronize board state and bookings in real time, and implement session replay with event recording. Ensure all features are accessible, secure, and maintainable.
