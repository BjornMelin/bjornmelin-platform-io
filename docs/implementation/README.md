# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for various features and improvements to the platform.

## Active Implementation Plans

### [Contact Form Security Enhancement](./contact-form-security-enhancement.md)
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Timeline**: 2 days
- **Priority**: Critical (CVE-2025-29927 fix required)
- **Description**: Pragmatic security fixes for the contact form without over-engineering

## Implementation Philosophy

Our implementation plans follow these principles:

1. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Avoid over-engineering for hypothetical future needs
2. **Pragmatic Solutions**: Choose the simplest solution that solves the actual problem
3. **Security First**: Address critical security issues immediately
4. **Appropriate Scale**: Solutions should match the actual usage patterns
5. **Rapid Delivery**: Prefer 2-day fixes over 3-week migrations

## Plan Structure

Each implementation plan includes:
- Executive summary with timeline and scope
- Detailed technical implementation steps
- Testing and validation requirements
- Success metrics and criteria
- What we're explicitly NOT doing (and why)

## Creating New Plans

When creating new implementation plans:
1. Start with the actual problem, not the desired solution
2. Consider the simplest approach first
3. Document what you're NOT doing and why
4. Include realistic timelines based on actual work required
5. Define clear success metrics
