# AWS Migration Assessment Archive

This directory contains archived documentation from the AWS migration assessment that was conducted but ultimately rejected in favor of a simpler approach.

## Archived Files

- **ARCHITECTURE-COMPARISON.md**: Side-by-side comparison of AWS vs Resend approaches
- **REASSESSMENT-SUMMARY.md**: Summary of the reassessment that led to the simplified approach

## Decision Outcome

After thorough analysis, the decision was made to:
1. Keep Resend as the email service provider
2. Implement pragmatic security fixes without over-engineering
3. Avoid unnecessary AWS service complexity

See [ADR-001: Keep Resend for Email Service](../../adrs/ADR-001-keep-resend-for-email.md) for the official architectural decision.

## Why Archived?

These documents represent research and planning that, while thorough, proposed an over-engineered solution for a portfolio website handling ~10 email submissions per month. They are preserved here for historical context but should not be used as implementation guidance.
